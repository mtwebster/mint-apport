  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * SECURITY FIX: kernel_crashdump: Enforce that the log/dmesg files are not a
    symlink.
    This prevents normal users from pre-creating a symlink to the predictable
    .crash file, and thus triggering a "fill up disk" DoS attack when the
    .crash report tries to include itself. Also clean up the code to make this
    easier to read: Drop the "vmcore_root" alias, move the vmcore and
    vmcore.log cleanup into the "no kdump" section, and replace the buggy
    os.walk() loop with a glob to only catch direct timestamp subdirectories
    of /var/crash/.
    Thanks to halfdog for discovering this!
    (CVE-2015-1338, part of LP #1492570)
  * SECURITY FIX: Fix all writers of report files to open the report file
    exclusively.
    Fix package_hook, kernel_crashdump, and similar hooks to fail if the
    report already exists. This prevents privilege escalation through symlink
    attacks. Note that this will also prevent overwriting previous reports
    with the same same. Thanks to halfdog for discovering this!

apport (2.14.1-0ubuntu3.11) trusty-security; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE: When /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable is enabled, crashing a
    program that is suid root or not readable for the user would create
    root-owned core files in the current directory of that program.  Creating
    specially crafted core files in /etc/logrotate.d or similar could then
    lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.  Now core files do
    not get written for these kinds of programs, in accordance with the
    intention of core(5).
    Thanks to Sander Bos for discovering this issue!
    (CVE-2015-1324, LP: #1452239)
  * SECURITY UPDATE: When writing a core dump file for a crashed packaged
    program, don't close and reopen the .crash report file but just rewind and
    re-read it. This prevents the user from modifying the .crash report file
    while "apport" is running to inject data and creating crafted core dump
    files. In conjunction with the above vulnerability of writing core dump
    files to arbitrary directories this could be exploited to gain root
    privileges.
    Thanks to Philip Pettersson for discovering this issue!

apport (2.13-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. Changes since our previous merge:
    - Do not report keys starting with '_' to the crash database. This can be
      used for keeping private keys in .crash files between crash and report
      time, or to store data between hooks etc., without cluttering reports.
    - UI: In "run all pending crashes" mode, skip reports that happened during
      logout in a desktop (specifically, logind) session; they are
      uninteresting and confusing to see at the next login. (LP: #1033932)
      They can still be reported manually with running the .crash file
      directly, but this sufficiently reduces the need to explicitly flag
      whether the report concerns a logout crash. (LP: #1067646)
    - Add support for PID namespaces (Linux containers): Crashes originating
      from a container on a system running a >= 3.12 kernel will be
      automatically redirected to apport inside the container, or ignored if
      apport is not installed in the container. Thanks to St√©phane Graber!
    - Print a warning when trying to retrace a report from a foreign
      architecture and gdb-multiarch is not installed. (LP: #1239395)
    - etc/init.d/apport: Don't change core_pattern when running in a

  * apport/ui.py: Rename "MarkForUpload" whoopsie hack field to
    "_MarkForUpload" and remove delta from launchpad.py. Fields starting with
    '_' are now considered private.
  * debian/apport.upstart: Add "%P" macro to core_pattern, to enable Linux
    container handling with upstart.

apport (2.12.1-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release. Changes since our previous snapshot:
    - Drop apport-noui in favour of whoopsie-upload-all. We don't want to
      process hooks when run noninteractively, since they may ask questions or
      determine a report is not due to a bug in Ubuntu. whoopsie-upload-all
      skips these hooks.
    - apport/report.py: Gracefully handle being unable to get the source package
      for a binary package, as when the latter does not exist in the cache.
      (LP: #1097773)
  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu-gnome.py: Switch to Tim Lunn's duplicate DB for
    the Ubuntu GNOME PPA.

  * Merge from trunk:
    - sandboxutils.py, make_sandbox(): Install packages from Package: and
      Dependencies: fields also if we have a ProcMaps: field and there are any
      third-party packages. This fixes retracing crashes that use PPAs (as they
      don't have Contents.gz).
    - Robustify "progress bar visible" GTK and KDE UI checks for the faster
      collection due to dropping lsb_release.

    - Eliminate multiple calls to lsb_release by caching the result. On
      systems which provide /etc/os-release, use that instead of lsb_release.
      (LP: #1164742)
    - launchpad.py: Show the Python major version in the error message about

      upstart crashes. Thanks James Hunt. (LP: #1203744)
    - Rename apport-gtk-mime.desktop to apport-gtk.desktop and drop the
      old apport-gtk.desktop that wasn't even being installed. With that, the
      window will be shown as "Report a problem..." instead of "Apport-gtk" in

      <configdir>/<release>/codename with the release's code name in it.

    - Ignore implausibly low addresses when computing
      StacktraceAddressSignature.  These are usually artifacts from gdb when

    - apport-retrace: Keep compressed CoreDump from .crash files instead of
      uncompressing them into memory. This dramatically reduces memory usage.
      (LP: #981155)
    - Add an apport.memdbg() function which prints out current memory usage if
      APPORT_MEMDEBUG is set. Annotate apport-retrace with it.
    - hookutils.py: Allow specifying a list of profile names when using
      attach_mac_events(). Thanks Marc Deslauriers.
    - hookutils.py, attach_root_command_outputs() and root_command_output():
      Drop usage of sudo, kdesudo, and gksu, and replace with pkexec. For
      attach_root_command_outputs(), use a wrapper and proper .policy file
      which explains the action and works under every environment; thus
      attach_root_command_outputs() is preferred over root_command_output()
      now, as it provides a better user experience.
    - Package hooks which want to send the report to a different crash
      database than "default" can now also give the database specification
      itself in the "CrashDB" field, not just the DB name. With this, packages
      do not need to ship a separate /etc/apport/crashdb.conf.d/ file. Please
      see doc/package-hooks.txt for details. (LP: #551330)
    - report.py, add_hooks_info(): If reporting against a package/program in
      /opt, also search for package hooks in the corresponding /opt directory.
      This allows such hooks to define a custom crash database and thus report
      bugs against their own project instead of against the distribution.

  * New upstream release. Changes since our previous snapshot:
    - Add new "RecoverableProblem" report type for problems which the
      application can handle, but still wishes to notify the user and send a
      problem report about. As an example, the application may wish to notify
      the user because handling the error resulted in degraded functionality.
      The user interface may fail to load items, or the action just performed
      may not return any data. Applications call
      /usr/share/apport/recoverable_problem with a string of arbitrary
      NUL-separated key/value pairs that are added to the report. Thanks Evan
      Dandrea!
    - launchpad.py: Fix setting of 'Medium' importance on duplicate checking.
    - apport-retrace: Fix StacktraceSource generation for relative --cache
      paths.
    - crashdb.py, check_duplicate(): Do not try to mark a bug as duplicate of
      itself. This can happen when re-processing a previously retraced bug.
    - apport-retrace: Fix UnicodeDecodeError when encountering a non-ASCII
      source code file and running under a non-UTF-8 locale.

  * New upstream release:
    - launchpad.py: Rework test suite to not use Launchpad's +storeblob

      the comment and attachments ourselves, and just assume that storeblob
      works on production.  Also change the structure to allow running every
      test individually.
    - crash-digger: Add --crash-db option to specify a non-default crash
      database name. (LP: #1003506)
    - apport-gtk: Add --hanging option to specify the process ID of a hanging
      application. If the user chooses to report this error, apport will
      terminate the pid with SIGABRT, otherwise it will send SIGKILL. The
      normal core pipe handler will be used to process the resulting report
      file, with a .hanging file in /var/crash to separate these from regular
      crashes.
    - apport: Also treat a binary as modified if the /proc/pid/exe symlink
      does not point to an existing file any more. (LP: #984944)
    - Fix PEP-8 violations picked up by latest pep8 checker.
    - ui.py: Do not ignore certain exceptions during upload which are not
      likely to be a network error.
    - launchpad.py: Recongize Launchpad projects for bug query and marking
      operations. (LP: #1003506)
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix get_source_tree() to work with apt sandboxes.
    - apport-retrace: Turn StacktraceSource generation back on, now that it

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - test/run: Do not run pep8 and pyflakes when running against the sytem
      installed Apport.
    - test_backend_apt_dpkg.py: For the "are we online" check, verify that we can
      download from http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/, not just whether we have a default
      route. The latter is not sufficient for e. g. buildd environments which are
      online, but are restricted by proxies or firewalls.
    - test_report.py: Call "sync" after test script write core dumps, to ensure
      that subsequent operations have a complete one.
    - test_signal_crashes.py: Drop the broken and obsolete test_local_python()
      test. Instead, add two tests which check proper logging.
    - launchpad.py: Fix urlopen() for Python3. Thanks Steve Langasek.
    - test/run: Run the tests under LC_MESSAGES=C, to avoid failing tests on
      translated strings.
  * debian/control: Add libc6-dbg | libc6-dbgsym dependency to apport-retrace,
    to ensure gdb can decipher the abort_msg_s struct and thus read assertion
    messages. Also add libc6-dbg to debian/tests/control so that
    report.test_add_gdb_info_abort can succeed in autopkgtest.
  * debian/control, debian/tests/control: apport-retrace needs a terminal
    emulator, so add an x-terminal-emulator dependency. Add xterm as build and
    autopkgtest dependency, so that the tests have one available.
  * debian/control: Drop python-launchpadlib from Depends to Suggests for
    python-apport, too.

  * New upstream release:
    - testsuite: Run with Python 3 by default. To test with Python 2, run
      "PYTHON=python2 test/run".
    - apport: Redefine sys.std{out,err} when redirecting output, as they are
      None in Python 3 when being called from the kernel.
    - test/test_signal_crashes.py: Clean up unexpected core dumps on failed
      test cases.
    - apport-gtk: Fix crash when closing the crash dialog while the
      information is being collected.
    - hookutils.py, xsession_errors(): Fix crash when running under a non-UTF8
      locale.
    - data/apport: Do not use sys.stdin.fileno(), it is invalid when being
      called from the kernel with Python 3.
    - data/apport: When core dumps are enabled, read them from the written
      report instead of directly from stdin (and then reading the written core
      file into the .crash report). If the core file size is limited, we
      otherwise stop reading the core dump from the kernel in the middle and
      have no (or a broken) core dump to be put into the report.
    - data/apport: Properly close the written crash report before changing its
      permissions to be readable. This prevents having crash reporting UI from
      looking at incomplete .crash files.
  * debian/rules: drop explicit setting of $PYTHON, test suite is now run

  * New upstream release:
    - Clean up module imports.
    - test/run: Run pyflakes, if available.
    - package_hook: Add --tags option. Thanks to Brian Murray.
    - launchpad.py: Drop the external multipartpost_handler.py (which is not
      portable to Python 3) and replace it with using the standard email
      module.
    - launchpad.py: Also work with Python 3. Deal gracefully with a missing
      "launchpadlib" module; this is not yet available for Python 3, but not
      required for client-side reporting.
    - apport-kde: Port to work with Python 3.
    - apport-retrace: Fix crash when using the --procmaps option.
    - setup.py: Update hashbang lines of installed scripts in data directory
      to the python executable setup.py was run with, similar to what already
      happens to scripts installed to ../bin/.
    - apport-cli: Port to work with Python 3.
    - setup.py: When fixing hashbang lines of installed scripts, only include
      the major Python version.
    - hookutils.py, read_file, attach_file(), attach_file_if_exists(): Convert
      file contents to unicode if the contents is UTF-8, or the newly added
      force_unicode argument is True.
    - hooktuils, command_output(): Convert output to unicode by default, and
      add a "decode_utf8" parameter to disable this.
    - hookutils.py, recent_logfile(): Fix fd leak.
    - data/apport: Do not assume that sys.stdout and sys.stderr always have a
      name; they can be None in Python 3.
    - data/dump_acpi_tables.py: Fix for Python 3.
  * data/package-hooks/source_debian-installer.py: Port to work with Python 3.
  * Move to Python 3, except for the parts that need python-launchpadlib
    (which is not yet available for Python 3):
    - debian/control: Add python3-problem-report and python3-apport packages.
    - debian/control: Switch build and binary dependencies to Python 3
      equivalents, except for apport-retrace.
    - debian/rules: Override dh_auto_* to also handle python3-* packages (see
      Debian #597105).
    - debian/rules: Run test suite with Python 3.
    - debian/rules: Switch hashbang line of apport-retrace back to Python 2.
    - Move /etc/apport/crashdb.conf from python-apport to apport, and
      recommend apport from both python{,3}-apport.
  * bin/apport-bug: Force running with python 2 when being invoked as
    apport-collect, and add a check/error message that you need to install
    python-apport to use this.
  * test/test_hookutils.py: Drop duplicate definition of _get_mem_usage(), now
    identical again to trunk.
  * ./test/test_ui_gtk.py: Drop duplicate definition of
    test_immediate_close(), now identical again to trunk.
  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Do not decode result of command_output(),

  * data/package-hooks/source_linux.py: Add a __main__ for debugging. Stop
    importing hookutils into the global namespace.
  * data/package-hooks/source_ubiquity.py: Fix undefined command_output().
  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Move definition of wrong_grub_msg and
    grub_hook_failure to the correct place, so that this actually works.
  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Drop definition of unused "cloud" variable.
  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Do not import hookutils symbols into global

  * New upstream release:
    - launchpad.py: When closing a bug as a duplicate, copy some well-known
      tags to the master bug. Thanks Brian Murray.
    - launchpad.py: Set importance of Python crash reports to "Medium" by
      default, similar to signal crashes. Thanks Brian Murray.
    - hookutils.py: Add attach_default_grub() convenience function from the
      grub2 package hook so it can be used by other packages. Thanks Brian
      Murray.
    - launchpad.py: Make Launchpad bug subscription user/team configurable:
      The initial subscriber after filing a bug can be set with the
      "initial_subscriber" crashdb option, and the team which gets subscribed
      after retracing with "triaging_team". (LP: #980726)
    - report.py: Do not change the SourcePackage: field if the binary package
      is not installed and does not exist. This fixes source package hooks to

      overlap. (part of LP: #993810)
    - apport-gtk, apport-kde: Avoid collecting information twice in "bug

  * New upstream release:
    - packaging.py, install_packages(): Add permanent_rootdir flag and if set,
      only unpack newly downloaded packages. Implement it for the apt/dpkg
      backend. Thanks Evan Dandrea.
    - apport-retrace: Add --sandbox-dir option for keeping a permanent sandbox
      (unpacked packages). This provides a considerable speedup. Thanks Evan
      Dandrea.
    - crash-digger: Add --sandbox-dir option and pass it to apport-retrace.
    - Fix the whole code to be PEP-8 compatible, and enforce this in test/run
      by running the "pep8" tool.
    - GTK UI tests: Ensure that there are no GLib/GTK warnings or criticals.
    - Support Python 3. Everything except the launchpad crashdb backend now
      works with both Python 2 and 3. An important change is that the load(),
      write(), and write_mime() methods of a ProblemReport and apport.Report
      object now require the file stream to be opened in binary mode.
    - data/apport: Ignore a crash if the executable was modified after the
      process started. This often happens if the package is upgraded and a
      long-running process is not stopped before. (LP: #984944)
    - Add test cases for apport-unpack.
    - apport-retrace: Add information about outdated packages to the
      "RetraceOutdatedPackages" field.
    - ui.py: Drop python-xdg dependency, use ConfigParser to read the .desktop
      files.
    - apport-gtk: Work around GTK crash when trying to set pixmap on an
      already destroyed parent window. (LP: #938090)
    - data/dump_acpi_tables.py: Fix crash on undefined variable with
      non-standard tables. (LP: #982267)
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix crash if a package is installed, but
      has no candidates in apt. (LP: #980094)
    - data/general-hooks/generic.py: Bump minimum free space requirement from
      10 to 50 MB. 10 is not nearly enough particularly for /tmp. (LP: #979928)
    - hookutils.py, recent_logfile(): Use a default limit of 10000 lines and
      call "tail" instead of reading the whole file. This protects against
      using up all memory when there are massive repeated log messages.
      (LP: #984256)
    - apport-gtk: Do not assume that an icon requested for size 42 actually
      delivers size 42; some themes do not have this available and deliver a
      smaller one instead, causing overflows. Also, copy the image as
      gtk_icon_theme_load_icon() returns a readonly result which we must not
      modify. (LP: #937249)
    - ui.py: Don't show the duplicate warning when the crash database does not
      accept the problem type, and they are just being sent to whoopsie.
      Thanks Evan Dandrea. (LP: #989779)
    - report.py: Correctly escape the file path passed to gdb.
    - apport-gtk, apport-kde: Do not show the information collection progress
      dialog if the crash database does not accept this kind of report. In that
      case whoopsie will upload it in the background and the dialog is not

apport (2.0-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: This is the final 2.0 release, featuring the
    overhauled and simplified GUI, support for whoopsie-daemon, and
    client-side duplicate checking.
    - report.py, anonymize(): Only replace whole words, not substrings.
      (LP: #966562)
    - apport_python_hook.py: Fix filtering of
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply exceptions. (LP: #958575)
    - crashdb.py: When publishing the crash database, cut hash file names
      after quoting, to avoid that the quoting causes them to become too long.
      (LP: #968070) This also uncovered that known() did not actually find any
      signature which contained an URL-quoted character, therefore breaking
      client-side duplicate checking in a lot of cases. Double-quote the file
      name now, as urlopen() unquotes it.
    - Add a new crash database option "problem_types" and a CrashDatabase
      method "accepts(report)". This can be used to stop uploading particular
      problem report types to that database. E. g. a distribution might decide
      to not get "Crash" reports any more after release.  Document the new
      option in doc/crashdb-conf.txt.
    - ui.py: Do not upload a report if the crash database does not accept the
      report's type. This behaviour is not really correct, but necessary as
      long as we only support a single crashdb and have whoopsie hardcoded.
      Once we have multiple crash dbs, we need to not even present the data if
      none of the DBs wants the report. See LP #957177 for details.
      (LP: #968121)
    - ui.py: Do not short-circuit information collection if report already has
      a "DistroRelease" field, as the GUIs add that in some cases. Check for
      "Dependencies" instead. This fixes information collection for kernel
      problems (which now has a full GTK GUI test case). (LP: #968488)
  * Merge from trunk:
    - test_ui_gtk.py: Disable package hooks for the tests, as they might ask
      for sudo passwords and other interactive bits, and thus make the tests
      hang.

  * New upstream release:
    - apport-gtk, apport-kde: When reporting a "system crash", don't say "...
      of this program version", but "...of this type", as we don't show a
      program version in the initial dialog
      (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker#error) (LP: #961065)
    - problem_report.py, write_mime(): Do not put a key inline if it is bigger
      than 1 kB, to guard against very long lines. (LP: #957326)
    - etc/cron.daily/apport: Do not remove whoopsie's *.upload* stamps every
      day, only if they are older than a week. whoopsie comes with its own
      cron job which deals with them. Thanks Steve Langasek. (LP: #957102)
    - report.py, mark_ignore(): Fix crash if executable went away underneath
      us. (LP: #961410)
    - apport-gtk: Do not compare current continue button label against a
      translated string.  Instead just remember whether or not we can restart
      the application. (LP: #960439)
    - hookutils.py, command_output(): Add option to keep the locale instead of
      disabling it.
    - hookutils.py, command_output(): Actually make the "input" parameter
      work, instead of causing an eternal hang. Add tests for all possible
      modes of operation.
    - hooktuils.py: Change root_command_output() and
      attach_root_command_outputs() to disable translated messages
      (LC_MESSAGES=C) only as part of the command to be run, not already for
      the root prefix command. This will keep the latter (gksu, kdesudo, etc.)
      translated. (LP: #961659)
    - apport-gtk: Cut off text values after 4000 characters, as Gtk's TreeView
      does not get along well with huge values. KDE's copes fine, so continue
      to display the complete value there. (LP: #957062)
    - apport-gtk: Make details window resizable in bug reporting mode.
    - crashdb.py, known(): Check the address signature duplicate database if
      the symbolic signature exists, but did not find any result. (LP: #103083)
    - ui.py: Run anonymization after checking for duplicates, to prevent host
      or user names which look like hex numbers to corrupt the stack trace.
      (LP: #953104)
    - apport-gtk: Require an application to both have TERM and SHELL in its
      environment to consider it a command line application that was started
      by the user. (LP: #962130)
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, _check_files_md5(): Fix double encoding,
      which caused UnicodeDecodeErrors on non-ASCII characters in an md5sum
      file. (LP: #953682)
    - apport-kde, apport-gtk: Only show "Relaunch" if the report has a
      ProcCmdline, otherwise we cannot restart it. (LP: #956173)
    - apport-gtk, apport-kde: Show the ExecutablePath while we're collecting
      data for the crash report. Thanks Evan Dandrea. (LP: #938707).
  * debian/copyright: Change to copyright format 1.0.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.

  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py: use main.log to determine UpgradeStatus not
    apt.log (LP: #886111)

apport (1.94.1-0ubuntu2) precise; urgency=low

  * Merge from trunk:
    - ui.py: Ensure that the report file is readable by the crash reporting
      daemon after running through collect_info(). Thanks Evan Dandrea.
    - apport-gtk, apport-kde: Set the window title to the distribution name, as
      per http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker#error . Thanks Evan Dandrea.
      (LP: #948015)
    - test/run: Ignore obsolete packages on the system, to avoid breaking the
      GUI tests due to them.
    - hookutils.py, attach_alsa(): Add the full "pacmd list" output instead of
      just sinks and sources. Thanks David Henningsson.
    - apport-gtk: Fix handling of non-ASCII strings in message dialogs.
      (LP: #865394)

  * New upstream bug fix release. Changes since our previous snapshot:
    - apport-cli: Consistently handle unicode vs. byte arrays. (LP: #946207)
    - report.py, anonymize(): Fix crash when the hostname or user name contain
      non-ASCII characters. (LP: #945230)
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix UnicodeDecodeError on unexpected md5sum output.
      (LP: #921037)
    - apport-gtk: Fix handling of non-ASCII strings in message dialogs.

  * Merge from trunk:
     - collect_info(): Do not assume that reports have a "ProblemType" field.
       This is not the case when updating a bug. (LP: #947519)
     - Re-enable inadvertently disabled "bug report for uninstalled package"
       test.
     - Update translations from Launchpad.

apport (1.94-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release:
    - apport: Set the group of written reports to "whoopsie" if that group
      exists.
    - Fix tests to run properly against the system-installed modules and
      binaries.
    - test/run: Run under LC_MESSAGES=C to avoid test failures due to
      translated strings.
    - general-hooks/generic.py: Also attach xsession-errors for programs that
      link to libgtk-3.
    - launchpad.py: Properly handle "Expired" status, to avoid marking new
      bugs as duplicates of expired ones. (LP: #941854)
    - apport: Fix crash if the "whoopsie" group does not exist. (LP: #942326)
    - report.py, crash_signature(): Do not put "<module>" frames into Python
      crash signatures that happen outside of function/method calls. Fall back
      to the file/line number as a frame description instead. This will do a
      much better job at disambiguating e. g. different ImportError crashes.
      (LP: #920403)
    - Make "binary changed since the time of the crash" error message more
      comprehensible, thanks Paolo Rotolo. (LP: #942830)
    - crashdb.py, check_duplicate(): It can happen that a bug gets identified
      as being a duplicate of bug S by symbolic signatures and a duplicate of
      bug A by address signatures. Empirical evidence shows that this is due
      to the unavoidable jitter in stack traces (A and S not being identified
      as duplicates as their signatures differ slightly) and not a logic
      error. So instead of erroring out, duplicate all three bugs and keep the
      lowest number as the master ID. (LP: #943117)
    - Revert the usage of multiple nested threads during data collection, and
      switch back to only using one UI thread. The UI implementations can, and
      now do, decide between showing a spinner and showing a progress dialog
      in the ui_*_info_collection_progress() methods. This fixes libX11
      crashes when multiple UI threads do changes concurrently (LP: #901675),
      and also avoids multi-thread induced crashes in Pango (LP: #943661). The
      removal of the collect() method also fixes the new crashes in it.
      (LP: #942098, #939803)
    - ui.py, get_desktop_entry(): Fix crash on uninstalled package.
      (LP: #940984)
    - data/unkillable_shutdown: Fix crash on race condition when PID goes away
      while the report is created. (LP: #546369)
    - apport/hookutils.py, pci_devices(): Fix crash on unexpected lines from
      lspci. (LP: #904489)
    - Drop hardcoded "Ubuntu" words again which crept in with the whoopsie
      support merge. Use the DistroRelease: field.
    - apport-kde: Fix Home page URL in KApplication metadata.
    - apport-gtk: Fix resizability and size after hiding details.
      (LP: #405418)
    - test/run: Drop "local" argument. This now tests against the source tree
      when run in the source tree root, and against the system
      libraries/programs when run from anywhere else.
    - test/run: Consider command line arguments as test names and only run
      those when given. Also support just running a single test.
    - testsuite: Force the skipping of online tests when $SKIP_ONLINE_TESTS is
      set.
    - hookutils.py, xsession_errors(): Add a reasonable default pattern which
      matches glib-style warnings, errors, criticals etc. and X window errors.
      In data/general-hooks/generic.py, call it with that default instead of
      the rather incomplete custom pattern. (LP: #932660)
    - packaging.py: Add get_package_origin() method, and implement it for
      apt-dpkg.
    - report.py, add_package_info(): Add "[origin: ...]" tag to "Package" and
      "Dependencies" fields for any package which is not native to the
      distribution. If any such package is present, tag the report with
      "third-party-packages" in data/general-hooks/generic.py. (LP: #927912)
    - apport/packaging.py: Add get_uninstalled_package() method as a helper
      method for the test suite. Use it instead of a hardcoded Debian/Ubuntu
      specific name in test/test_hooks.py.
    - test/test_ui_{gtk,kde}.py: Add test cases for complete UI workflow runs
      for reporting a bug against an installed/uninstalled package, and
      reporting a crash with and without showing details. This reproduces the
      recent crashes like LP #901675 or LP #943661.
    - test_ui.py: Add a test case for reporting a complete report on
      uninstalled package. This happens when reporting a problem from a
      different machine through copying a .crash file.
    - test/run: Add a test that there are no hardcoded "Ubuntu" words in the
      source. The code should use the DistroRelease: field or lsb_release.
  * debian/apport-retrace.install: Ship crash-digger. There is no reason any
    more not to, as it's now very easy to set up a retracer bot environment.
  * debian/apport.install: Install crash.{class,jar} into test suite
    directory, so that the test_java_crashes.py test can run.
  * debian/control: Tighten dependencies to ensure that we don't run a newer
    UI package against an older python-apport, which would cause crashes due
    to API mismatches. (LP: #939702)
  * Drop test/test_backend_rpm.py, as we also drop the RPM backend in the
    Ubuntu branch.
  * debian/rules: Update test suite invocation, the "local" argument is
    obsolete.

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - apport-gtk: Fix crash on nonexisting icon. Thanks Evan Dandrea.
      (LP: #937354)
    - ui.py, open_url(): Revert back to calling sudo instead of dropping
      privileges ourselves; with the latter, calling firefox as the sudo'ing
      user fails. (LP: #916810, #938128)
    - ui.py: Fix aborting with "AssertionError" if the report is already
      known, but without an URL. (LP: #938778)
    - launchpad.py: If a bug is already known, but the report is private, do
      not send the report. There is little sense piling up lots of duplicates.
      (LP: #938700)
    - test/crash: Fix regression of test_crash_apport(), consider $TERM a
      non-sensitive variable.
    - ui.py: Fix test failures for data collection progress, they are not
      expected to happen for "ProblemType: Crash" any more (happens in the
      background during sending, or if user clicks on "Show Details").
    - test/hooks: Use a package from Debian/Ubuntu main, so that this works
      better during package builds on build servers.
    - test/python: Do not assume that /var/crash/ exists. Use /var/tmp/ for
      the fake binaries instead.
    - data/general-hooks/parse_segv.py: Fix test case name.
    - ui.py: Fix crash on invalid core dumps. (LP: #937215)
    - launchpad.py: Fix crash on unicode report titles. (LP: #896626)
    - apport-gtk: Show the most interesting fields first in the details view.
    - do-release: Call pyflakes and abort on errors other than unused imports.
    - Move all test suites out of the code modules into test/test_<module>.py.
      This avoids having to load it every time the program runs, and also
      allows running the tests against the installed version of Apport.
    - Clean up the other executable test script in test/* and change them to
      the same structure as the module tests.
  * debian/control: Add python-mock and GTK gir build dependencies for the
    gtk/kde tests.
  * debian/control: Add procps dependency to avoid a "command not found" error
    for killall in the ubuntu.py general hook during the test suite.
  * debian/control: Add missing python-gi dependency to apport-gtk.

    - launchpad.py: Keep "Dependencies" attachment in duplicates. Thanks Brian

apport (1.91-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - crashdb.py, check_duplicate(): If a crash has a signature but no
      existing duplicate in the DB, also check for an existing address
      signature duplicate in the DB.
    - apport-retrace: Use DistroRelease specific subdirectory of the cache dir
      for mapping a file to a package, as these maps are release specific.
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Refresh Contents.gz cache if it is older than one
      day.
    - crashdb.py: Ensure that address_signature duplicate db table does not
      have multiple identical signatures by making it a primary key. Bump the
      db format to "3". Existing databases need to be migrated manually as
      SQLite does not allow adding a "PRIMARY KEY" constraint to existing
      tables.
    - crashdb.py: Do not add a new address signature entry if one already
      exists.
    - apport-cli: Fix UnicodeDecodeError on unicode report values.
      (LP: #275972)
    - launchpad.py: Only set bug task importance if it is undecided.
    - apport-retrace: Fix "an useful" typo. (LP: #911437)
    - report.py: Filter out frames which are internal kernel/glibc
      implementation details and not stable across duplicates. In particular,
      filter out __kernel-syscall() and the SSE stubs.
    - crashdb.py: Remove debugging leftover which completely disabled bug
      pattern checking.
    - report.py: Update reading AssertionMessage. Current (e)glibc turned
      __abort_msg from a simple static string into a struct.
    - Change permissions of .crash files from 0600 to 0640, so that /var/crash
      can be made g+s and crash handling daemons can access those.
    - Python exceptions: Blacklist DBus.Error.NoReply. It does not help to get
      these traces from the client-side application, you need the actual
      exception in the D-Bus server backend instead. (LP: #914220)
    - Support /etc/apport/whitelist.d/ similarly to /etc/apport/blacklist.d/,
      for cases like installer environments where only crashes of a few selected
      programs should be reported.

apport (1.90-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: First beta release of 2.0 which introduces
    client-side duplicate checking.
    - report.py: Break out new method stacktrace_top_function() from
      standard_title(), so that other parts of the code can use this as well.
    - launchpad.net: When sending retraced results back to the bug report,
      update the topmost function in the bug title. (LP: #869970)
    - report.py, add_gdb_info(): Add a new field "StacktraceAddressSignature"
      which is a heuristic signature for signal crashes. This should be used
      if crash_signature() fails, i. e. the Stacktrace field does not have
      enough symbols. This can be used to check for duplicates on the client
      side, provided that the crash database server supports querying for
      these.  Do not expose this field when uploading to crash databases
      though, as it can be recomputed from the already existing information
      (ProcMaps and Stacktrace) and thus would just clutter the reports.
    - crashdb.py: Add a table "version" with the database format version. Add
      automatic upgrading to the most current format.
    - crashdb.py: Put address signatures from reports checked with
      check_duplicate() into the duplicate database, so that implementations
      of known() can check for these.
    - dupdb-admin: Add "publish" dupdb-admin command which exports the
      duplicate database into a set of text files suitable for WWW publishing.
    - crashdb.py: Add new method "known(report)" which can be implemented to
      check if the crash db already knows about the crash signature. If so,
      the report will not be uploaded, and instead the user will be directed
      to the existing report URL (if available), similar to bug patterns. The
      default implementation checks this format, if the crash database is
      initialized with a "dupdb_url" option pointing to the exported database.
    - launchpad.py: Override known() to check if the master bug is actually
      accessible by the reporter, and is not tagged with "apport-failed-retrace"
      or "apport-request-retrace"; otherwise file it anyway.
    - crash-digger: Add --publish-db option to conveniently integrate
      duplicate DB publication (similar to dupdb-admin publish) into retracer
      setups.
    - launchpad.py: Attach updated stack traces from a duplicate to the master
      bug if it failed retracing previously or has an "apport-request-retrace"
      tag. (LP: #869982)
    - apport-kde, apport-gtk: Support the "Annotation" field for custom dialog
      titles for "Crash" and "Package" problem types as well, not just for
      "Kernel". (LP: #664378)
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix another test case failure when ddeb
      repository is not enabled.
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix handling of explicit cache directory
      name when it is a relative path.
    - launchpad.py: Only query for bugs after 2011-08-01, to avoid timeouts.
    - ui.py: Also anonymize standard bug title. (LP: #893863)
    - launchpad.py: Current Launchpad cannot have private bugs which affect
      multiple projects. Fix test suite accordingly.
  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Fix crash if "apport" package is not
    installed, which might happen on local installs or running the test suite.
  * etc/default/apport: Re-enable Apport by default; we want reports early in
    Precise, and we also do not have unstable GNOME versions this time which
    have known problems. We also have client-side duplicate detection now
    which should mitigate the noise.
  * Drop debian/pyversions, debian/pycompat: Obsolete with dh_python2.

apport (1.26-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Port to current python-apt API.
    - hookutils.py: Fix path_to_key() to also work with unicode arguments.
    - test/crash: Exit successfully if apport is not enabled in the system.
      This allows packages to run the test suite during build.
    - report.py, add_proc_info(): Correctly handle "python -m <modulename>"
      programs as being interpreted and determine the appropriate module path.
    - Fix some import statements to also work for the system-installed test
      suite.
    - test/run: Fix testing data/general-hooks/parse_segv.py when called in
      system-installed mode.
    - apport/ui.py: Clean up test .crash file after test cases.
    - Fix tests when running as root.
    - setup.py: Fix crash when "javac -version" fails.
    - README: Update command for one-time enablement.
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix interleaving usage of
      install_packages() with other operations such as get_version(), by
      resetting the apt status after building and using the sandbox.
    - report.py test suite: Remove requirement that $USER is set, which makes
      it easier to run this from package build environments.
    - apport/ui.py, test/crash: Use "yes" as test process instead of "cat".
      The former is less likely to run already, and does not depend on having
      a stdin, so it runs better in test environments like autopkgtest.
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix tests if system does not have a
      dbgsym apt source.
    - Ignore a crash if gnome-session is running and says that the session is
      being shut down. These often die because X.org or other services are
      going away, are usually harmless, and just cause a lot of clutter in bug
      trackers.  (LP: #460932)
    - test/crash: Rewrite using Python's unittest, to be in line with other
      tests, and be easier to maintain and extend.
  * Add debian/tests/control and debian/tests/upstream-system:
    DEP-8/autopkgtest control file for running the upstream tests.
  * debian/control: Bump minimal Python version to 2.7, as the upstream trunk
    is now moving to Python 3 compatibility; some of the new syntax does not
    work with 2.6 yet.
  * debian/control: Update apport-retrace package description, apport-chroot
    is gone. Also drop the now obsolete Suggests.
  * debian/rules: Run tests during package build, but do not let them fail the
    build just yet. It will still take a while until all test suceed in the
    buildd environment.
  * debian/control: Add gdb and python-twisted-core build dependencies, so
    that the test suite can succeed.
  * debian/control: Move python-gobject and gir1.2-glib-2.0 dependencies from
    apport-gtk to apport, as our generic.py hook needs it. Also add them to
    build depends for the test suite.
  * debian/control: Add missing lsb-release dependency, used by
    Report.add_os_info().
  * debian/control: Add net-books build dependency, test suite uses "route" to
    determine whether or not to run the online tests.

apport (1.25-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Add new response "Examine locally" to presenting the report details,
      which runs apport-retrace in the chosen mode in a terminal. This should
      be made available for crash reports if apport-retrace and a Terminal
      application are installed; add an abstrace UI method for this.
      (LP: #75901)
    - apport-gtk: Add "Examine locally..." button, and implement
      ui_run_terminal().
    - apport-cli: Add "Examine locally..." responses, and implement
      ui_run_terminal().
    - apport-cli: Greatly speed up displaying large reports. This also changes
      the format to avoid indenting each line with a space, and visually set
      apart the keys in a better way.
    - apport_python_hook.py: Move tests out of this file into test/python, to
      avoid having to parse the unit tests at each Python startup.
    - test/python: Also make tests work if Python hook is not installed in
      system's sitecustomize.py.
    - packaging.py: Add get_modified_conffiles() API, and implement it in
      packaging-apt-dpkg.py.
    - hookutils.py: Add attach_conffiles().
    - hookutils.py: Add attach_upstart_overrides().
    - launchpad.py: Remove "Ubuntu" in bug response, replace with "this
      software". (LP: #883234)
    - apport-kde: Rearrange order of imports to get intended error message if
      PyKDE is not installed.
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Ignore hardening-wrapper diversions, to make
      gcc_ice_hook work if hardening-wrapper is installed.
    - apport_python_hook: Respect $APPORT_REPORT_DIR.
    - apport_python_hook: Limit successive crashes per program and user to 3
      per day, just like signal crashes. (LP: #603503)
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Skip online tests when there is no default route.
    - ui.py: Fix test suite to not fail if system has some obsolete or
      non-distro packages.

apport (1.24-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.23.1:
    - apport/crashdb.py: Ensure that duplicate table only has one entry per
      report ID.
    - apport-retrace: Pass correct executable path to gdb in --gdb with
      --sandbox mode.
    - apport-retrace: Do not leave behind temporary directories on errors.
    - apport-retrace: Drop assertion failure for existance of "Stacktrace".
      This isn't present in the case of gdb crashing, and there is not much we
      can do about it. This should not break the retracer.
    - apport/report.py: Unwind XError() from stack traces for the
      "StacktraceTop" field, as they take a significant part of the trace.
      This causes bugs to be duplicated which really have different causes.
  * New upstream release 1.24:
   - apport-retrace: Add --timestamp option to prepend a timestamp to log
     messages. This is useful for batch operations.
   - crash-digger: Call apport-retrace with --timestamps, to get consistent
     timestamps in log output.
   - hookutils.py: Add two new functions attach_gsettings_package() and
     attach_gsettings_schema() for adding user-modified gsettings keys to a
     report. (LP: #836489)
   - hookutils.py: Add new function in_session_of_problem() which returns
     whether the given report happened in the currently running XDG session.
     This can be used to determine if e. g. ~/.xsession-errors is relevant and
     should be attached.
   - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, install_packages(): Also copy
     apt/sources.list.d/ into sandbox.
   - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, install_packages(): Install apt keyrings
     from config dir or from system into sandbox. (LP: #856216)
   - packaging.py, backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Define that
     install_packages() should return a SystemError for broken
     configs/unreachable servers etc., and fix the apt/dpkg implementation
     accordingly.
   - apport-retrace: Don't crash, just give a proper error message if servers
     are unreachable, or configuration files are broken. (LP: #859248)
   - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Fix crash when
     /etc/apport/native-origins.d contains any files. (LP: #865199)
   - hookutils, recent_logfile(): Fix invalid return value if log file is not
     readable. (LP: #819357)
   - test/crash: Fix race condition in the "second instance terminates
     immediately" check.
   - hookutils.py: Replace attach_gconf() with a no-op stub. It used static
     python modules like "gconf" which broke the PyGI GTK user interface, and
     gconf is rather obsolete these days.
   - ui.py, open_url(): Greatly simply and robustify by just using xdg-open.
     This already does the right thing wrt. reading the default browser from
     GNOME, KDE, XCE, and other desktops. (LP: #198449)
   - data/general-hooks/generic.py: Only attach ~/.xsession_errors if the bug
     is reported in the same XDG session as the crash happened. (LP: #869974)
   - Ignore crashes for programs which got updated in between the crash and
     reporting. (LP: #132904)
   - Special-case crashes of 'twistd': Try to determine the client program and
     assign the report to that, or fail with an UnreportableReason.
     (LP: #755025)
   - apport-gtk: In bug update mode, make details dialog resizable and fix
     default size. (LP: #865754)
   - apport-gtk: Fix crash if report does not have ProcCmdline. (LP: #854452)
   - hookutils.py, attach_wifi(): Anonymize ESSID and AP MAC from "iwconfig"
     output. (LP: #746900)
   - test/crash: Fix test failure if user is not in any system groups.
   - test/crash: Change to /tmp/ for test crash process, to fix failure if the
     user that runs the test suite cannot write into the current directory.
     (LP: #868695)
   - ui.py: Improve error message if package is not a genuine distro package.
     Thanks to Ronan Jouchet. (LP: #559345)
  * debhelper/dh_apport: Install debian/source.apport into the first binary
    package only, as per documentation. (LP: #687584)

  * data/package-hooks/source_ubiquity.py: Do not create a DuplicateSignature
    for bugs with a Traceback included as it is redundant

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release:
    - crashdb.py, crash-digger, dupdb-admin: Drop the concept of "duplicate DB
      consolidation". Such massive queries cause timeouts with e. g.
      Launchpad. Instead, update the status of potential master bugs in the
      crash DB whenever check_duplicate() is called. Note that this does not
      affect Ubuntu itself, just the retracers in the data center.
    - launchpad.py: Fix crash in close_duplicate() if master bug was already
      marked as a duplicate of the examined bug.
    - problem_report.py, load(): Fix missing last character if the last line
      in a multi-line field is not terminated with a newline.
    - launchpad.py: Fix test_marking_python_task_mangle() check to work with
      current Launchpad.
    - apport-retrace: If the user did not specify a --cache directory, create
      a shared one instead of letting the two install_packages() calls create
      their own. This ensures that the apt and dpkg status is up to date, and
      avoids downloading the package indexes multiple times. (LP: #847951)
    - apport-retrace: Give proper error mesage instead of AssertionError crash
      if a report does not contain standard Apport format data. (LP: #843221)
    - fileutils.py, get_new_reports(): Fix crash if report file disappears in
      the middle of the operation. (LP: #640216)
    - apport/ui.py, load_report(): Intercept another case of broken report
      files. (LP: #445142)
    - apport/report.py, standard_title(): Escape regular expression control
      characters in custom exception names. (LP: #762998)
  * data/package-hooks/source_ubiquity.py: Fix crash if
    prepare_duplicate_signature() does not return anything. (LP: #843911)

  * New upstream release:

    - dupdb-admin: Use the in-memory CrashDB implementation for simple
      operations like dump or changeid, which do not require an actual
      backend. This makes the command work in checkouts without a
      /etc/apport/crashdb.conf.
    - dupdb-admin: Fix UnicodeEncodeError crash.
    - launchpad.py: Fix crash if a crash report does not have a DistroRelease.
    - Set the default "Apport" title for choice dialogs instead of the default
      apport-gtk title. Thanks Robert Roth. (LP: #608222)

  * data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py: generate a DuplicateSignature tag for
    distribution upgrades too.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release:
    - Completely rework apport-retrace to use gdb's "debug-file-directory" and
      "solib-absolute-prefix" settings and only unpack the necessary packages
      in a temporary directory. This makes it possible to use it in a running
      system without actually touching installed packages, does not need any
      root privileges, and stops the requirement of using chroots with
      fakechroot and fakeroot. This is a lot easier to maintain and use, and a
      lot faster, too.  As a consequence, drop the chroot module, and update
      crash-digger accordingly. See "man apport-retrace" for the new usage.
      It is now also easier to port to other packaging backends, as a lot of
      the common logic moved out of the packaging API;
      packaging.install_retracing_packages() got dropped in favor of the
      simpler packaging.install_packages(). (LP: #832740)
    - launchpad.py: When searchTasks() times out, exit with 99 as this is a
      transient error.
    - crash-digger: Intercept OverflowError from downloaded compressed
      attachments.
    - crash-digger: Show how many bugs are left in the pool with each new
      retrace.
  * Drop debian/local/apport-chroot and manpage, and ubuntu-fat-chroot. These
    are obsolete now with the new apport-retrace.
  * Drop debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Most of it is obsolete now,
    setting up a retracer merely needs an lp:apport checkout and creating an
    apt sources file, we don't need a script for that any more.

apport (1.21-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Changes since our previous trunk merge:
    - Supply --desktop option to kdesudo to improve the description which
      program is requesting administrative privileges.
    - apport-checkreports: Exit with status 2 if there are new reports, but
      apport is disabled. This helps crash notification GUIs to not display new
      crash reports in that case. Thanks to Michael Vogt for the original patch.
    - Add data/is-enabled: Shell script to check if apport is enabled.
      Non-Python programs (which can't use apport.packaging.enabled() ) can
      call this instead of having to parse /etc/default/apport themselves, and
      just check the exit code. Inspired by original patch from Michael Vogt.

apport (1.20-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Changes since our previous snapshot:
    - Add support for -w/--window option which will enable user to select a
      window as a target for filing a problem report. Thanks Abhinav Upadhyay.
      (LP: #357847)
    - Disable the filtering on SIGABRT without assertion messages. Turns out
      that developers want these crash reports after all. (LP: #729223)
    - Add support for a "DuplicateSignature" report fields. This allows
      package hooks to implement custom duplicate problem handling which
      doesn't need to be hardcoded in Apport itself. Update the launchpad
      backend to tag such bugs as "need-duplicate-check".
    - hookutils.py Update WifiSyslog regex to correctly catch application log
      messages in syslog. Thanks Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre. (LP: #732917)
    - hookutils.py, attach_hardware(): Avoid error message if machine does not
      have a PCI bus. Thanks Marcin Juszkiewicz. (LP: #608449)
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Replace deprecated getChanges() call
      with get_changes().
    - apport-gtk: Fix broken dialog heading if the name of the crashed program
      contains an & or other markup specific characters.
    - apport-gtk: Don't crash if GTK cannot be initialized. This usually
      happens without a $DISPLAY or when the session is being shut down. Just
      print an error message. If there are pending crashes, they will be shown
      again the next time a session starts. (LP: #730569)

  * New upstream release:
    - apt backend: Do not generate a warning if the opportunistically added -dbg
      package does not exist.
    - apt backend: Only add -dbg in --no-pkg mode, as there will be conflicts in
      normal package mode.
    - apt backend: Call tar with target cwd instead of using -C; the latter causes
      an extra openat() call which breaks with current fakechroot.
    - launchpad.py: Fix retracer crash if DistroRelease field does not exist.
    - Convert deprecated failIf()/assert_() TestCase method calls to
      assertFalse()/assertTrue().
    - In apport-bug, if the user specifies a PID referring to a kernel thread,
      do the right thing and file the bug against the kernel
    - In hookutils.attach_dmesg, skip over an initial truncated message if one
      is present (this happens when the ring buffer overflows)
    - Change bug patterns to just use one central file instead of per-package
      files. This allows bug patterns to be written which are not package
      specific, and is easier to maintain as well. IMPORTANT: This changed the
      format of crashdb.conf: bug_pattern_base is now obsolete, and the new
      attribute bug_pattern_url now points to the full URL/path of the patterns
      file. Thanks to Matt Zimmerman!
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Drop local installation of packages,
    we now just check that they are installed in the system.
  * debian/local/apport-chroot: Convert --auth argument to absolute path, as
    fakechroot needs that.

    README.blacklist from python-apport to apport, it fits better there.

    - Order symptom descriptions alphabetically. Thanks to Javier Collado.
    - Check $APPORT_SYMPTOMS_DIR environment variable for overriding the
      system default path. Thanks to Javier Collado.
    - testsuite: Check that crashdb.conf can have dynamic code to determine DB
      names and options.
    - ui.py test suite: Rewrite _gen_test_crash() to have the test process
      core dump itself, instead of using gdb to do it. The latter fails in
      ptrace restricted environments, such as Ubuntu 10.10.
    - launchpad.py: Use launchpadlib to file a bug instead of screen scraping.
      The latter was completely broken with current Launchpad, so this makes
      the test suite actually work again. Thanks to Diogo Matsubara!
    - launchpad.py: Change $APPORT_STAGING to $APPORT_LAUNCHPAD_INSTANCE, so
      that you can now specify "staging", "edge", or "dev" (for a local
      http://launchpad.dev installation). Thanks to Diogo Matsubara!

apport (1.11-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Add "--save" UI option to store the collected information into an
      .apport file instead of sending it right away. The file can then later
      be sent through apport-bug. Update manpages accordingly.
    - Update all copyright and description headers and consistently format
      them.
    - Rename all TestCase classes to "_T", which makes it much easier to run
      individual tests from the command line.
    - Testsuite: Verify that report details are/are not shown. This uncovered
      that details about package installation failures were not shown before
      sending them, which is fixed now.
    - test/hooks: Do not try to add hook information to kernel_crashdump test
      case, since we do not have an UI here. This test case broke when the
      system had an interactive package hook for the kernel.

apport (1.10-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Add a mode for updating an existing problem report to ui.py
      (-u/--update).  This is similar to the Ubuntu specific "apport-collect"
      tool, but implemented the right way now: In particular, this has access
      to the UI and thus can use interactive hooks (LP: #385811) and show you
      what is being sent for confirmation/cancelling (LP: #371827)

    - apport-bug: If invoked as "apport-collect" or "apport-update-bug" (i. e.
      through a symlink), run apport in update mode (-u <number>). This
      provides a convenient no-options command line program. Please note that
      setup.py does not currently install such a symlink. Update the
      apport-bug manpage accordingly.

    - launchpad.py: Use new login_with() to clean up code, and specify allowed
      access levels (WRITE_PRIVATE is the only sensible one anyway).
      (LP: #410205)

    - New hookutils functions:
      + xsession_errors (match lines from ~/.xsession-errors)
      + shared_libraries (determine which libraries a binary links with)
      + links_with_shared_library (test if a binary links with a particular
        library)

    - New CrashDatabase API: get_affected_packages(), can_update(), is_reporter()

    - Rename CrashDatabase.update() to update_traces().

    - Add CrashDatabase.update() for adding all new fields of a report. This is
      primarily useful for collecting local standard and package hook data for an
      already existing bug report which was not filed through Apport. This checks
      can_update()/is_reporter() if the user is eligible for updating that
      particular bug. (LP: #485880)

    - Ignore SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ; thanks to Kees Cook. (LP: #498074)

apport (1.9-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Add "do what I mean" mode to command line argument parsing (applies to
      all interfaces: -cli, -gtk, -kde). When giving a single argument and no
      options, determine the most likely mode, like reporting a bug against a
      symptom, package, executable name, or PID.
    - Add program "apport-bug" which determines the most appropriate user
      interface (GTK, KDE, CLI) and files a bug through it, using the single
      argument "do what I mean" mode. This is an improved version of Ubuntu's
      "ubuntu-bug" script.
    - Update apport-cli manpage to current set of options and behaviour. Also
      point out that apport-gtk and apport-kde share the same CLI.
    - setup.py now installs apport-{gtk,kde} into $prefix/share/apport/, they
      are not supposed to be called directly. This also reflects the path
      which the .desktop files expect.
    - setup.py now installs the internal helper scripts like
      "kernel_crashdump", "apport", or "apportcheckresume" into
       $prefix/share/apport instead of $prefix/bin.
    - Update usage of gettext to work around Python bug of gettext() not
      returning unicodes, but str. Fixes UnicodeDecodeErrors on translated
      --help output.
    - Add missing gettext wrapping for user-visible strings in
      apport-{retrace,unpack} and ui.py; thanks to Marco Rodrigues!
    - backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Robustify get_{source,architecture} for
      uninstalled packages
    - ui.py: Add --version option. Thanks Marco Rodrigues! (LP: #383694)
  * debian/local/apport-collect: Fix KeyError crash on nonexisting LP bug
    number. Thanks Marco Rodrigues! (LP: #424273)
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes necessary).
  * debian/local/apport-collect: Point out that you need to select "Change

  * debian/control: Drop obsolete texlive-latex-recommended build dependency.
  * debian/rules: Drop --install-scripts, upstream now installs the files and
    binaries into the right place. Adapt debian/*.install accordingly.
  * Drop debian/local/ubuntu-bug{,.1} and replace them with symlinks to
    apport-bug{,.1}, which is a more robust version of ubuntu-bug.

apport (1.6-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Add support for kernel crashes, thanks to Michael Vogt!
    - apport/ui.py, run_crash(): Do not re-collect information if we already
      have a Dependencies field. This happens when calling apport on an already
      pre-processed .crash file with -c. (LP: #394497)

      just the last one. (LP: #398906)

      so that they do not count as "free". (LP: #341720)
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Support additional custom native origins in
      /etc/apport/native-origins.d/ . (LP: #386052)
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Drop PPA origin hack, launchpad behaves properly
      now

      e. auto-launched). LP: #396243)

    - Drop all Makefiles, po/POTFILES.in, and most code from setup.py, and use
      DistUtilsExtras.auto which "just does the right thing" for most build
      system tasks. This requires python-distutils-extra >= 2.2, see
      https://launchpad.net/python-distutils-extra
    - Move all test scripts into test/, to unclutter source tree.
    - setup.py now auto-detects the required packaging backend if
      apport/packaging_impl.py is not manually installed.
  * debian/control: Add python-distutils-extra build dependency.
  * debian/rules: Drop stuff which is now properly done by the upstream build

    with interactive hooks, but is a good enough immediate bandaid.

  * Merge fixes from trunk:
    - packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Add backwards compatibility code for python-apt <
      0.7.9 to not break backportability.
    - hookutils.py, command_output(): Force LC_MESSAGES=C, to avoid translated
      output in bug reports. (LP: #383230)
    - apport-gtk.ui: Make details window resizable, and lower default size, so
      that it will fit on small screens. (LP: #365517)

      + See doc/package-hooks.txt for details.
      + See UbuntuSpec:desktop-karmic-symptom-based-bug-reporting
    - New function apport.hookutils.root_command_output() to run a command as root,

apport (1.2.1-0ubuntu3) karmic; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no changes necessary).
  * debian/control: Bump debhelper dependency for dh_icons, to satisfy
    lintian.
  * general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Fix IndexError crash if report does not have a
    Package field. Check whether we actually have attach_conffiles() (which is
    not the case when running the upstream version).
  * Merge trunk:
    - launchpad.py: Fix crash for unset titles.
    - Add segfault analysis hook for quick segv reviews. Thanks to Kees Cook!
    - run-tests: Replace hardcoded Python path with dynamically detected path.

    - Drop "UnsupportableReason" field, it is too similar to
      UnreportableReason and just confusing.
    - ui.py: Check UnreportableReason for run_report_bug() as well.
      (LP: #361359)
    - general-hooks/generic.py: Do not report problems with low free space on
      / or /home. (LP: #381047)

      + packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Use python-apt >= 0.7.9 official API and drop
        usage of internal symbols.
      + hookutils.py: Drop hal related functions and queries, replace with
        udev database, udev log file, and DMI information from sysfs.
      + gtk UI: Convert from libglade to gtk.Builder.
    - Bug fixes:

        specific.
      + apportcheckresume: Fix log collection from pm-utils.
      + Fix various crashes and report properties for reporting against
        uninstalled packages.
  * debian/control: Drop python-glade2 dependency, bump python-gtk2 dependency
    to ensure availability of gtk.Builder.
  * hookutils, attach_conffiles(): Remove leftover debugging spew.
  * debian/apport-qt.install: Install the individual Qt .ui files instead of
    *.ui, since GTK's are now also called *.ui.

apport (1.1.1-0ubuntu2) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * hookutils.py: Do not attach /proc/version_signature, it's Ubuntu specific.
    (Merged from trunk). Instead, attach it in general-hooks/ubuntu.py.
  * general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Attach package conffile information.
  * debian/local/apport-collect: Add workaround for launchpadlib bug
    LP#353805, to avoid crashing with non-UTF8 attachments. (LP: #368004)
  * debian/local/apport-collect: Fix import of launchpadlib's HTTPError.
  * apport/hookutils.py, attach_conffiles(): Ignore empty lines from
    dpkg-query output.
  * general-hooks/ubuntu.py: Strip off '/target' prefix from ExecutablePath
    and InterpreterPath, to correctly process crash reports from the live
    system installer.
  * apport/hookutils.py, attach_conffiles(): Do not use command_output(),
    since that causes error messages to get parsed as conffiles. Use
    subprocess properly.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Replace deprecated python-apt properties
    with current ones (merged from trunk). Update python-apt dependency to 
    >= 0.7.9.
  * packaging-apt-dpkg.py, get_modified_files(): Do not show package list file
    as modified if the package is not installed (merged from trunk).

  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, install_retracing_packages(): Fix syntax
    error which broke the retracers.

  * New upstream security update:
    - etc/cron.daily/apport: Only attempt to remove files and symlinks, do not
      descend into subdirectories of /var/crash/. Doing so might be exploited by
      a race condition between find traversing a huge directory tree, changing
      an existing subdir into a symlink to e. g. /etc/, and finally getting
      that piped to rm. This also changes the find command to not use GNU
      extensions.  Thanks to Stephane Chazelas for discovering this!

  * New upstream release:
    - Drop some remaining distro specific pieces of code from non-backends.
    - Add hookutils methods for attaching relevant packages, greatly improve
      attach_alsa() for sound problem debugging. 
    - Move launchpad crash database implementation from ever-breaking
      python-launchpad-bugs (screenscraping) to launchpadlib (official and
      stable Launchpad API). (LP: #353879)
    - Add new field Report.pid which gets set on add_proc_info() and can be
      used by hooks.
    - setup.py: Properly clean up all generated files, install missing
      mimetypes/text-x-apport.svg icon symlink.
    - Add README file.
    - Add translations from Launchpad.
    - Remove preloadlib/*; it's undermaintained, and not really useful any
      more these days.
    - Various bug fixes; most visible being the misnamed
      etc/default/apport.default file (which should just be
      etc/default/apport).
  * Merge some bug fixes from trunk:
    - launchpad.py: Send and read Date: field again, reverting r1128; it is
      useful after all. (LP: #349139)
    - report.py, add_proc_info(): Only add ProcAttrCurrent if it is not
      "unconfined".
    - ui.py: Detect invalid PIDs (such as for kernel processes) and give a
      friendly error message. (LP: #360608)
    - report.py, add_hooks_info(): Always run common hooks, and run source
      package hooks if we do not have a binary package name. (LP: #350131)
    - launchpad.py: Consider socket errors when connecting as transient, so
      that crash-digger doesn't stop completely on them.
  * Drop debian/apport.README.Debian, superseded by upstream README.
  * Drop debian/apport.links, done by upstream setup.py now.
  * debian/rules, debian/apport.preinst: Drop upgrade fix for misnamed default
    file again, was only necessary for intra-Jaunty upgrades.
  * debian/control: python-launchpad-bugs ‚Üí python-launchpadlib dependencies.
  * debian/local/apport-collect: Drop launchpadlib login code, just use the
    CrashDatabase implementation from apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py.
  * Make package backportable to hardy and intrepid:
    - debian/control: Relax python-central buil-dependency to 0.5.6.
    - debian/rules: Determine DH_PYCENTRAL value ("include-links" vs.
      "nomove") based on the installed pycentral version.
    - debian/rules: Only supply --install-layout=deb when Python version is
      2.6.
  * apport/hookutils.py: Add docstring for attach_hardware, thanks Matt
    Zimmerman! (Merged from lp:~mdz/apport/hookutils)
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Support older wadllib API
    where bug.date_created was a string instead of a datetime object.
    (Cherrypicked from trunk).
  * debian/control: Drop apport dependency to python-xdg, it's not required.
    (LP: #354172)
  * debian/control: Drop gdb from Depends: to Recommends:. (LP: #354172)
  * debian/local/apport-collect: Print a friendly error message instead of
    crashing if the bug number is not an integer. (LP: #351050)
  * debian/local/apport-collect: Change incomplete tasks back to "New" after
    data collection. (LP: #363126)
  * debian/apport.links: source_linux-meta.py -> source_linux.py package hook,
    so that apport-collect works on "linux" source bug tasks. These get
    opportunistically translated into binary packages, but the binary "linux"
    is built by the source "linux-meta". (LP: #350131)
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer:
    - Use ports.ubuntu.com for non-{i386,amd64,lpia}.
    - Set up Jaunty by default.
    - Fix test for being in local unpackaged apport source tree.
    - Drop installation of python-launchpad-bugs.
    - Install bzr branches/packages necessary for launchpad, in a shared
      ~/launchpadlib/ tree: launchpadlib, wadllib, oauth, lazr.uri, httplib2,
      simplejson.
    - Clean up apport-chroot calling for extra packages.

  Do some internal cleanup of distribution specific stuff:

  * problem_report.py, man/apport-unpack.1: Fix description of .crash file
    syntax (RFC822, not "Debian control").
  * Move cron.daily, init script, and default file from debian/ to etc/, and
    install them in setup.py. These files are appropriate for upstream
    installation.
  * Move crashdb.conf and doc/README.blacklist to etc/, to simplify setup.py.
  * setup.py: Move *.mo generation/installation into my_install_data class,
    for cleanliness.
  * Move installation of missing packages for retracing from
    bin/apport-retrace to new abstract interface apport/packaging.py,
    install_retracing_packages() and remove_packages(), and move the apt/dpkg
    code to backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py. This removes a major piece of
    apt/dpkg specific code from non-backends.
  * bin/apport-retrace: Rename option --no-dpkg to --no-pkg and update
    bin/apport-chroot accordingly.
  * Move bin/apport-chroot and man/apport-chroot.1 to debian/local, since they
    are totally Debian/Ubuntu specific.
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Update apport-chroot and crashdb.conf
    paths for above changes.
  * apport/hookutils.py, files_in_package(): Replace dpkg-query call with
    packaging.get_files(), to avoid Debianism.
  * man/apport-retrace.1: Drop reference to "apt", simply talk about package
    installation.

  Bug fixes:

  * setup.py: Fix homepage URL.
  * debian/local/apport-chroot: If multiple distro IDs point to the same
    chroot, do not upgrade them more than once with "upgrade all".

    file, or a program path. This does the right thing when calling it with a

    master bug will un-duplicate the bug.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/{launchpad,memory}.py: Implement duplicate_of() and
    add test cases. The Launchpad test case reproduces the

    python-launchpad-bugs bzr head.
  * apport/ui.py, open_url(): Also consider a sesssion as "GNOME" if gconfd-2

  * debian/local/ubuntu-fat-chroot: Divert away
    /usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.1b3/xulrunner-bin. It is called on debian/rules
    patch in xulrunner-1.9.1 and hangs eternally in the fakechroots. This is
    only a temporary kludge, though, until the next xulrunner version lands.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Add test case: Update a bug report which
    got marked as a duplicate during processing. This reproduces #349407.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, update(): Intercept and ignore IOErrors

  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Support new CrashDB option "project"
    which can be set to a LP project name to file bugs against that project
    instead of the distribution. Add test case for filing crash bug against a
    project, updating it, duplicating/unduplicating it, and determining fixed
    version. (LP: #338835)
  * bin/crash-digger: If apport-retrace exits with 99, consider it a transient
    error and just stop the retracer, but don't leave the lock file behind.
    Add appropriate test case to test-crash-digger.
  * bin/apport-retrace: If apt update fails due to a "hash sum mismatch", exit
    with a "transient error" code, to stop (but not break) the retracing
    cycle.

      rid of all the logging, daemonizing, and looping code.
    - Adapt stdout/stderr reporting to be suitable for cron and
      redirecting stdout to a log file.
    - Use lock files to avoid overlapping instances and avoid damaging
      bugs with broken retracers after crash-digger failed.
    - Handle chroot upgrading, so that this does not need separate
      cronjobs any more.
    - Drop old -i option, replace with -D/--dupcheck which is a mode
      which *only* checks duplicates of Python crashes (no fakechroot
      handling).
    - Mark bug as retraced after apport-chroot retrace finished
      successfully; the process is robust enough now to avoid enless
      loops even if retracing fails.

    scripts (work in progress)
  * Extend ubuntu-bug to accept a path as an argument and look up the package
    name
  * Rename kernel_hook to kernel_crashdump (there are other kernel hooks)
  * Change kernel crash report type to KernelCrash
  * Fix automatix.py to not crash when automatix isn't installed (LP: #267004)
  * Add bin/kernel_oops hook to capture a kernel oops (eg. via kerneloops)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add AUTHORS file for collecting the list of major contributors and
    copyright holders.
  * apport/report.py: If we do not find a bug pattern file for the binary
    package, fall back to looking for one with the source package name.
  * run-tests: Provide a better error message if apport/packaging_impl.py does
    not exist.

  [ Brian Murray ]

  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: If PackageArchitecture is 'all', fall
    back to looking at Architecture instead of not adding a

  The "(Kernel) OOPS, I dumped it again!" release.

  * apport/ui.py: Fix test_run_report_bug_unpackaged_pid() to work with the
    installed run-tests from the package as well.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Ignore broken LP bug tasks instead of
    crashing on them.
  * apport/report.py, add_proc_info(): Report the AppArmor or SELinux context
    in a new ProcAttrCurrent field, read from /proc/pid/attr/current.
    Document it in doc/data-format.tex. The field will not be added if the
    proc attribute cannot be read or isn't present. Thanks to Steve Beattie
    for the patch and the suggestion!
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Switch to intrepid.
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Fix installation of python-apt. Also
    install apt, to avoid library version mismatches to python-apt.
  * debian/apport.default: Enable apport by default again, now that we have
    working retracers.
  * apport/report.py, test_add_gdb_info_script(): Use bash, not dash as test
    program for core dumping; stack trace is awkwardly bad with dash, so that
    the test case cannot really work any more.
  * Add package-hooks/source_linux.py: Package hook for collecting kernel
    related information. By Matt Zimmerman, thank you! (LP: #251441)
  * debian/local/ubuntu-bug.1: Fix documentation of -p, it  specifies the
    binary package name, not the source.
  * apport/packaging.py: Add get_kernel_package() to return the actual Linux
    kernel package name; useful if the user reports a bug against just
    "linux". Implement it in backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py.
  * apport/ui.py: "Do what I mean" when filing a bug against "linux" and
    report it against the actual kernel package.
  * debian/local/ubuntu-bug: If just one argument is given, infer -p/-P from
    the type of the argument.
  * apport/ui.py: Drop the PackageArchitecture field for the uploaded report
    if it is equal to Architecture. Adapt apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py to
    fall back to Architecture, and mention the change in doc/data-format.tex.
  * problem_report.py, write_mime(): Add new "skip_keys" argument to filter
    out keys. Add test cases.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Do not write the "Date:" field on
    upload(), and fetch it from the bug metadata in download().
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, download(): Support reading bugs with
    the "--- " separator instead of "ProblemType: ". Launchpad doesn't create
    bugs that way ATM, but at least we have the reading part implemented now.
  * package-hooks/source_linux.py: Drop Uname, ProcVersion, and
    RunningKernelVersion fields, since they are all subsumed in the
    ProcVersionSignature field.
  * apport/ui.py, run_report_bug(): Strip spaces from package argument.
  * apport/ui.py, add_hooks_info(): Collect OS info first, then call the
    package hooks, so that the linux hook actually has a chance to delete the
    Uname field.
  * bin/kernel_hook, test-hooks: Throw away the original kernel hook which
    we never used (and got superseded by the proper source_linux.py package
    hook now). Replace it with the new logic of looking for
    /var/crash/vmcore{,.log} and turning that into an apport report.
  * debian/apport.init: Call kernel_hook if /var/crash/vmcore exists.
    (LP: #241322)
  * apport/ui.py: Collect information for "ProblemType: Kernel" as well, so
    that we run the package hook. Adapt test suite to cover this.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version (no required changes).
  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade, qt4/apport-qt: Generalize notification of kernel
    crash, since it now happens after a boot, not right after the BUG/OOPS.
    But in the future we want to cover both cases.

    into a fakechroot and exercise a lot of standard shell commands (cp, ln
    -s, rm, rm -r, mkdir, echo, chmod, chown, etc.) with absolute/relative
    paths.  This reproduces the total breakage of rm'ing, chmod'ing, and
    chown'ing absolute paths in hardy fakechroots.
  * bin/crash-digger: Intercept exceptions when downloading crash reports for
    duplicate checking, so that the retracer does not crash on malformed bug
    reports. (LP: #205178)
  * apport/packaging.py: Introduce a new function enabled() which reports
    whether Apport should create crash reports. Signal crashes are controlled
    by /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, but we need that to control whether
    reports for Python, package, or kernel crashes are generated.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Provide implementation for
    PackageInfo.enabled() for Debian/Ubuntu by evaluating /etc/default/apport.
    Add various test cases for different configuration files and absent files.

    'cow', 'squashmnt', and 'persistmnt' to allow apport to locate the
    executable pathname, additionally to 'rofs' added in 0.75.  This fixes
    apport for packages installed on the read-write part of the unionfs mounts

  * po/de.po: Fix typo (missing space).
  * debian/apport.default: Disable Apport for the final Hardy release, since
    it is less useful in stable releases, and drains a lot of CPU and I/O
    power on crashes. Disabling it here instead of in update-notifier/adept is
    more discoverable and more centralized.

  [ Daniel Hahler ]
  * bin/apport-retrace: catch the same exceptions from Report.load() like

    workaround: Create temporary .py symlinks for gtk/apport-gtk & friends,
    and have intltool extract them.

    reports a bug against a pid which belongs to an unpackaged program. This
    reproduces LP #203764.
  * apport/report.py: Drop add_hooks_info() assertion on nonexisting Package

  * doc/data-format.tex: Some updates to incorporate feedback from Gnome
    upstream:
    - Do not talk about "Distributions" any more, but "Operating systems".
      Gnome is used on non-Linux OSs, too.
    - Split "DistroRelease:" field into "OS:" and "OSRelease:".
    - Explicitly mention that CoreDump, StackTrace etc. can also contain
      minidump output.
    - Increase document version to 0.2.
  * apport/report.py, obsolete_packages(): Fix crash when apt does not know an
    available version of a package. (LP: #128176)
  * test-apport: Add check that apport aborts immediately if another apport
    instance is already running. Also test that a symlink attack on the lock
    file is not possible.
  * bin/apport: Abort running several apport instances at the same time, by
    lockf()'ing /var/crashes/.lock and aborting on failure. (LP: #119622)
  * Add bin/gcc_ice_hook: Script to create an apport report for a gcc ICE
    (internal compiler exception). Add test cases to test-hooks, and ship it
    in the 'apport' package. (LP: #125551)
  * run-tests: In 'local' mode, only explicitly run the apt/dpkg
    implementation instead of backends/*, since the RPM ones don't have tests
    yet.
  * apport/crashdb.py: Add a second optional parameter to upload() to specify
    an upload progress callback function. Adapt the declarations in the
    Launchpad and Memory implementations, too.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, upload(): Pass upload progress callback
    handler to launchpadBugs.storeblob.upload(), which supports this since
    version 0.2~39. Bump dependency to it accordingly.
  * apport/ui.py, file_report(): Define an upload progress callback handler,
    pass it to the crashdb upload(), and feed ui_set_upload_progress() with
    some actual data. (LP: #91521)
  * problem_report.py: Remove support for reading bz2 compressed binary data.
    That was only relevant during edgy's development cycle.
  * apport/report.py, test_add_proc_info(): Fix determination of /bin/zgrep
    interpreter.
  * problem_report.py: Switch encoding of binary values from bare zlib to
    proper gzip format, since this is much more useful when reusing the
    compressed value. Retain support for zlib-only reports. Add test cases for
    both old and new encodings, and adapt the other test cases for the new
    format. Update doc/data-format.tex accordingly.
  * problem_report.py, write(): Add new permitted 'binary' argument value
    'compressed', which retains gzip compressed binary values instead of
    unpacking them transparently. Add test cases.
  * problem_report, write_mime(): Eliminate unnecessary usage of StringIO.
  * problem_report, write_mime(): Make function work for compressed binary
    values. Add test case.
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Make function work if CoreDump is a
    compressed value.
  * apport/ui.py: Load crash report with keeping compressed binaries. This
    avoids loading the entire uncompressed core dump into memory, and avoids
    recompressing it all over again for generating the crash database upload
    MIME document. This greatly speeds up crash reporting, too. (LP: #98562)

  * Move ubuntu-fat-chroot from bin/ to debian/local/, since it is so heavily

  * debian/local/ubuntu-fat-chroot: Use diversions for the binaries we want to
    disable, so that chroot upgrades do not trash the modifications.
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: launchpad-crash-digger ->
    crash-digger.
  * bin/crash-digger: Add option -i/--arch-indep-dupcheck to explicitly enable

  * Add general-hooks/automatix.py: Refuse to send problem reports if

  * doc/package-hooks.txt: Do not document UnsupportableReason, since it does
    not make sense to set it in package hooks (it is checked before calling
    the hooks). Hooks should use UnreportableReason only.
  * apport/ui.py, test_run_crash_package(): Check that 'Package' problem
    reports collect additional information, too.
  * apport/ui.py, collect_info(): Collect additional information for 'Package'
    problem reports, too.
  * Revive preloadlib/:
    - Remove PIPE_CORE #ifdefs and make them the default. We do not need to
      support the Edgy kernel patches in this version any more.
    - Install signal handler for SIGABRT, too.
    - Read core ulimit, pass it to apport in CORE_REAL_RLIM, and set it to
      zero for the program, since we do not actually want the kernel to write
      core files when we pipe the core dump to apport.
    - test-apport: Pass APPORT_REPORT_DIR to the manually called apport
      instance in the memory clipping test; otherwise it'll write into
      /var/crash/, which we do not consider in library mode.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, __init__(): Only do the "download bug
    #2" hack if we actually have an authentication cookie. Thus, do it only on
    the retracing servers, not on the client side. (LP: #125142)
  * apport/report.py, crash_signature(): Generate a signature for one-line
    Python tracebacks, too. This sometimes seems to happen, e. g. LP#124588.

  * apport/crashdb.py: Split out duplicate_db_last_consolidation() for getting
    the date (or seconds since) the last consolidation, so that we can use it
    externally.
  * apport/crashdb.py: Add duplicate_db_change_master_id() to change the
    master ID of a crash. Add test case to apport/crashdb_impl/memory.py.

  Merge the fedora branch, thanks to Will Woods <wwoods@redhat.com>:

  * Add apport.init.fedora: Fedora specific init script.
  * Add apport.spec: RPM build recipe.
  * Add backends/packaging_rpm.py: Partial implementation of the packaging
    backend for RPM which applies to all RPM-based distros.
  * Add backends/packaging_fedora.py: Concrete packaging backend
    implementation for Fedora.
  * apport/elfcore.py: Classes for parsing general ELF files, and information
    from core dumps.
  * bin/apport: Fall back to reading signal number and PID directly from the
    core file (via elfcore.py) if CORE_SIGNAL and CORE_PID are not defined (i.
    e. when running on a non-Ubuntu kernel).
  * crashdb.conf: Add stanzas for Fedora and a 'debug' database which uses the
    'memory' crashdb implementation.

    epochs. Thanks to Will Woods <wwoods@redhat.com>!
  * apport/ui.py: Add option -c/--crash-file to run the UI with a particular

  * Add xdg-mime/apport.xml: XDG MIME type definition for .crash files.
  * Add gtk/apport-gtk-mime.desktop.in: Link text/x-apport MIME type to

  * Add debian/apport.links: Install an icon symlink for the MIME type.
  * apport/ui.py: Do not ask the initial "Do you want to report this?"
    question when being invoked with --crash-file.
  * po/POTFILES.in: Add missing cli/apport-cli.
  * po/de.po: Updated for apport-cli.

    it from a server to a workstation with internet connection, etc.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Simplify _subscribe_triaging_team(), now
    that we do not differ between main and universe policies any more.
  * apport/report.py: Support another hook directory
    /usr/share/apport/general-hooks/ for scripts which are run for every
    problem report. This was requested for adding e. g. AppArmor logs, etc.

apport (0.89) gutsy; urgency=low

  Implement private crash bug handling, according to
  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CrashReporting:

  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py:
    - upload(): If we have an Ubuntu bug, mark it as private and only
      subscribe 'apport' (the 'Apport retracing service' user).
    - Add function _subscribe_triaging_team() which subscribes
      ubuntu-crashes-main for source packages in Ubuntu main or restricted, or
      ubuntu-crashes-universe for other packages. It does not touch non-Ubuntu
      bugs, since these are not marked private by default and are outside of
      the scope of this spec.
    - update(), _mark_dup_checked(): Call _subscribe_triaging_team().
    - Note: This entire spec is a gross hack, and Ubuntu derivatives do not
      benefit from it at all. We have to live with this until LP grows a real
      crash database.
    - get_distro_release(): Make this function work with private bugs, too, by
      using p-lp-bugs' safe_urlopen().

  Bug fixes:

  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Revert simplification change of 0.85:
    BugList returns a set of strings, not integers; due to non-identity they
    do not work with the usual set operations.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Add function get_source_component() to
    query Launchpad for the component of a given distribution and source
    package. (This will be required for implementing crash-reporting).
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, _search_contents(): Package list is
    actually comma separated, only take the first item. This fixes retracing
    of e. g. #124139.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, _search_contents(): Fix package name
    parsing for non-main components. This fixes retracing of e. g. #124111.
  * apport/report.py, _read_maps(): Revert ptrace hack when maps cannot be
    read. maps file is now protected based on process ownership, not ptracing.
  * apport/crashdb.py, apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py,
    apport/crashdb_impl/memory.py: Remove official interface
    mark_dup_checked(), as it should only be an internally used function. Add
    report parameter, since we will need it there in the future. Remove
    explicit call from bin/crash-digger and instead change check_duplicate()
    to call it on its own.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, download(): Replace dodgy parsing of
    fields from the description with proper code, so that multi-line fields
    are read correctly, too.

  * po/de.po: Update.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, _search_contents(): Do not check the
    return value of zgrep. It usually errors out with 'stdout: broken pipe'
    when called with -m1.
  * bin/crash-digger: Mark a bug as retraced if DistroRelease: cannot be
    determined. Those are bugs apport cannot handle.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py, get_source_tree(): Call apt-get source
    with --assume-yes to not block on VCS confirmations.
  * apport/crashdb.py: Add interface mark_retrace_failed(). Implement it in
    apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py.
  * bin/apport-retrace: If retraced report does not have a crash signature,
    mark it as failed with above new function. Bump python-apport dependency
    for this.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, update(): Delete CoreDump.gz attachment
    if the retrace was successful (i. e. if the report has a crash signature).
  * apport/ui.py, test_run_crash(): Set the message box title, text, and
    severity as assertion message if the run_crash() test fails, so that you

  * test-apport: Check that apport does not create reports for emtpy core

  * problem_report.py: Introduce a fourth optional parameter "fail_on_empty"

    was read. Add test cases.
  * bin/apport: Enforce non-emptyness of CoreDump.
  * problem_report.py: Add test case for delayed piping of data passed as file
    object pointers. This was supposed to explain the reason for getting bugs
    with zero-byte core dumps, but already works correctly.
  * apport/report.py, check_ignored(): round the mtime to an int (just like
    mark_ignore() does), to not get wrong results on file systems that support
    subsecond file timestamps. This fixes running the test suite on the live
    CD.
  * test-apport: Clarify assertion message if /var/crash is not empty.

  * apport/report.py, crash_signature(): Allow ':' and '~' as part of function

  * apport/report.py test suite: Do not assume that /bin/zgrep uses /bin/sh,
    it was recently changed to use bash. Directly read the interpreter from
    the shebang line.
  * bin/apport-chroot, command_upgrade(): Supply -y to 'apt-get upgrade' also

  * apport/report.py, obsolete_packages(): Do not consider virtual packages as
    obsolete.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Do a bogus call to Bug() in the ctor.
    This initializes python-launchpad-bugs to use a cookie for the urlopen in
    BugList, so that get_unretraced() and get_dup_unchecked() return private

    - get_dup_unchecked() and mark_dup_checked() to get a list of crashes that
      need to be checked for being a duplicate and chalk them off. This is
      aimed at crashes which do not need retracing, such as unhandled Python
      exceptions.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Implement above methods for launchpad
    (moving the code from bin/launchpad-crash-digger).
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Set "need-duplicate-check" tag for

  * bin/launchpad-crash-digger: Drop Launchpad specific code and replace it
    with calls to above new functions. Rename to bin/crash-digger. Also rename
    all 'cookie' to 'auth' (as happened with the other applications earlier).
  * bin/crash-digger: Do duplicate checking for needs-duplicate-check crash

    the duplicate detection API of the base CrashDatabase (since it is
    much easier to test it here, on an actual implementation).
  * debian/pyversions: Bump minimal Python version to 2.5, since this starts
    providing the sqlite3 module.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Implement new methods required for crash
    duplicate detection. get_fixed_version() does not approximate version
    tracking yet; it just returns '' for fixed bugs (which means 'fixed, but
    unknown version'). Bump python-launchpad-bugs dependency for this to
    ensure the availability of Bug.mark_duplicate().
  * bin/apport-retrace: Add option --duplicate-db which specifies the path to
    the duplicate sqlite database and enables duplicate detection.
  * Abin/apport-chroot: Add option --duplicate-db. If a file is given, symlink
    it into the chroot and pass --duplicate-db to apport-retrace.
  * bin/launchpad-crash-digger: Add --duplicate-db and pass it to
    apport-chroot.
  * apport/crashdb.py: Track last run of duplicate_db_consolidate() in an
    extra table and add a method duplicate_db_needs_consolidation() which
    returns True if the last run was more than a given number of seconds ago.
    Add test cases to apport/crashdb_impl/memory.py.
  * bin/launchpad-crash-digger, fill_pool(): Check whether the duplicate
    database needs consolidation (i. e. updating the bug states to the reality
    in the bug tracker) and if so, trigger it.

apport (0.82) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Add bin/ubuntu-fat-chroot: Script to install a set of commonly needed
    packages into a minimal Ubuntu chroot (as created by apport-chroot). This
    requires some hacking of postinst and /usr/sbin/ files in between the
    installation stages and thus deserves a script on its own.
  * apport/packaging.py:
    - Add "uninstalled" option to get_file_package(). If set to True, this
      will do an expensive search of files/packages which are not installed.
    - Add interface "set_mirror(URL)" for functions which need to retrieve
      packages and data from distribution mirrors.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Implement "uninstalled" option and
    "set_mirror(URL)", add test cases.
  * bin/apport-retrace: Use "uninstalled" option now to install packages and
    corresponding -dbgsyms for uninstalled files mentioned in ProcMaps
    (Point 1 of apport-better-retracing spec). Bump python-apport dependency.
  * apport/packaging.py: Add interface get_available_version(package).
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Implement get_available_version(), add
    shallow test case.
  * apport/report.py: Add function obsolete_packages() to return packages in
    Package: and Depends: which are not up to date. Add test cases.
  * apport/ui.py, thread_collect_info(): For crashes, call obsolete_packages()
    and set UnreportableReason: if there are any (Point 2 of
    apport-better-retracing spec).
  * apport/ui.py, thread_collect_info(): call standard_title() and add it to
    the report as 'Title' field. This is useful if reporters modify the
    default title (per request of Brian Murray, thanks). Add test case.
  * apport/ui.py: Fix declaration of the test suite's
    ui_set_upload_progress(). Funny that this has never been triggered before.
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Split out StacktraceTop generation into
    separate funtion _gen_stacktrace_top(), so that we can test it separately.
  * apport/report.py, _gen_stacktrace_top(): Step back from the crashed
    program's own signal handlers, since those are generally not useful for
    the purposes of StacktraceTop and only impede duplicate matching
    (Point 4 of apport-better-retracing spec). Add various test cases.
  * apport/report.py: Add method crash_signature() to calculate an unique
    identifier of a signal or Python crash, to be used for duplicate
    detection. Add various test cases.
  * apport/packaging.py: Add interface get_source_tree() to fetch and unpack a
    source package to a given directory, optionally specifying a particular
    version.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Implement get_source_tree(). This has a
    rather crude 'call apt-get source and guess about directories'
    implementation until python-apt learns about doing this directly and more
    elegantly (see LP #118788).
  * bin/apport-retrace: Add gen_source_stacktrace() and a few helper functions
    to construct a field 'StacktraceSource' with the source code around the
    affected lines in the stack trace (as available). (Point 5 of
    apport-better-retracing spec).
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, update(): Attach StacktraceSource to the
    bug if it exists.
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Check PackageArchitecture for 'all', to
    not set a retracer tag 'need-all-retrace'.
  * test-apport: Clarify assertion failure message when an unexpected core
    dump is present.
  * apport/report.py, get_module_license(): Do not iterate over Popen.stdout,
    use communicate() instead. The latter is already fixed to not trip over
    SIGINTR. (LP: #118965)

  * apport/report.py: Remove '[apport]' default bug title prefix. (LP: #94819)
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Tag new bugs with
    'apport-<problemtype>'. This replaces the former '[apport]' prefixing.
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Specify a path in '.' command and
    use sh again. Yay for me needing three attempts before actually RTFMing
    how '.' works (which is really nasty and strange IMHO).
  * bin/apport-chroot: Fix symlinks before repackaging the chroot tarball in
    'install' and 'installdeb' modes.
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Install python-libxml2 and python-apt.
  * bin/launchpad-crash-digger: Supply --auth instead of the deprecated
    --cookie to apport-chroot.
  * bin/apport-chroot: Fix identifier name in command_retrace().
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Set APPORT_CRASHDB_CONF to the local
    crashdb.conf.
  * bin/apport-chroot: Unset APPORT_CRASHDB_CONF for login and retrace.
  * bin/launchpad-crash-digger: Check the release of a bug and whether we have
    a chroot for it before untagging it. This avoids loosing tags for bugs we
    do not yet have a working retracer chroot for.
  * bin/apport-retrace: Do not abort with an exception if package installation
    fails. Give a proper error message instead and point to -u. (LP: #115681)
  * apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py, update(): Create a temporary directory
    and use proper file names for the new attachments. With TemporaryFile(),
    attachment file names ended up as '<fdopen>'. (LP: #115347)
  * apport/report.py, add_os_info(): Add field 'NonfreeKernelModules' which
    lists loaded kernel modules which do not have a FOSS license. This is
    particularly helpful for quickly checking for restricted graphics drivers.
    (LP: #103239)
  * apport_python_hook.py: Move the apport.* imports into the try: block and
    move the likely_packaged() test to the top, to avoid importing
    apport.report and creating a Report object for non-packaged scripts. This
    makes the entire code more efficient and robust against errors in the
    apport modules. (LP: #109955)
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Intercept OSError from gdb invocation
    (which might be segfaulting itself) and just do not put any gdb output
    into the report. The automatic retracers can try their luck again.
    (LP: #112501)
  * bin/apport-retrace: Fix handling of packages which are still known to
    /var/lib/dpkg/status, but do not have an apt record any more; treat them
    like virtual packages and just issue a warning instead of falling over.
    (LP: #107474)
  * Add doc/data-format.tex: Documentation of the structure, encoding, and
    standard keys of the Apport report file format. [apport-for-upstreams
    blueprint]
  * Add doc/Makefile: Build and clean rules for generating data-format.pdf.
  * debian/rules, setup.py: Call doc/Makefile and install the PDF
    documentation. Add texlive-latex-recommended build dependency for that.

apport (0.80) gutsy; urgency=low

  Collect all Launchpad specific bits in a separate class and provide an
  abstract base class. This will greatly help for getting upstream acceptance
  and the possibility of automatically forwarding crashes upstream
  (apport-for-upstreams specification):

  * Add apport/crashdb.py: Abstract crash database interface. This also offers
    a factory function get_crashdb() which reads a configuration file to find
    the default crash database to be used.
  * Add ./crashdb.conf: Crash database configuration file, for Ubuntu on
    Launchpad. Modify setup.py and debian/python-apport.install to ship it in
    python-apport.
  * Add apport/crashdb_impl/memory.py: Simple in-memory implementation of
    crash database interface for testing.
  * Add apport/crashdb_impl/launchpad.py: Launchpad implementation of crash
    database interface.
  * apport/ui.py: Drop LP specific bits and move towards new CrashDatabase
    interface.
  * apport/ui.py, test suite: Do not overwrite file_report() any more, but
    use the memory CrashDatabase. This will test the actual file_report()
    implementation and allows the test suite to check the precise value of
    opened URLs.
  * apport/{report,ui}.py: Move UserInterface.create_crash_bug_title() and its
    test cases to Report.standard_title(). It is much more appropriate there
    and can be used in the retracer as well.
  * bin/apport-retrace: Drop LP specific bits and move to CrashDatabase
    interface. Remove the --remove-tag option, we really should not have it
    here; remove it from man/apport-retrace.1 as well.
  * bin/apport-chroot: Drop --remove-tag option here, too.
  * bin/apport-chroot: Drop LP specific bits and move to CrashDatabase
    interface.
  * bin/launchpad-crash-digger: Remove retracing tag directly instead of
    passing --remove-tag to apport-chroot. This is a much cleaner design and
    avoids infinitely looping on some weirdly failing retraces.
  * debian/control: Bump some python-apport dependencies for the API changes.

  Some debranding:

  * setup.py: Use apport wiki home page for 'url'.
  * Remove 'X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain' from *.desktop.in, since langpack.mk will
    add it automatically now.
  * *.desktop.in: Remove 'in Ubuntu' from comment.
  * cli/apport-cli, qt4/apport-qt: Generalize window titles.

  Other fixes:
  * po/de.po: Update.
  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Revert back 'source' to '.' and use
    bash instead of sh. POSIX sh does not seem to have a 'source' command.

apport (0.79) gutsy; urgency=low

  * debian/local/setup-apport-retracer: Fix '.' bashism, replace it with
    'source'.
  * problem_report.py, write_mime(): Drop preamble argument, replace it with
    an extra_headers dictionary. This is much easier to evaluate on clients.
  * apport/ui.py: Convert to new write_mime() interface from above. This
    finally automatically tags bugs with need-$ARCH-retrace. Bump
    p-problem-report dependency of python-apport for this.
  * apport/report.py: Change example URLs in the testsuite from launchpad to
    an artificial ones to avoid the impression that it is LP specific.
  * backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py: Formally make this a subclass of
    apport.packaging.PackageInfo.
  * debian/control: Use code.lp.net instead of bazaar.lp.net VCS URL.
  * bin/kernel_hook: Fix/improve the collected information:
    - Read /proc/modules instead of lsmod.
    - Fix lspci argument: -n instead of -m.
    - Add /proc/cmdline.
  * debian/rules: Use langpack.mk for updating the .desktop files.
  * Add po/Makevars to specify the domain, to make intltool figure out the
    gettext domain automatically.
  * bin/kernel_hook, ./test-hooks: Do not rely on /proc/version_signature any
    more, it's gone in the gutsy kernel.

  * apport/packaging.py, backends/packaging-dpkg.py: Add new interface
    is_distro_package(package) which verifies the origin of a given package.
    Move the dodgy hack from apport/ui.py to the backend, where it belongs to.
    Also add a test case.
  * debian/control: Add python-apt dependency to python-apport.
  * debian/control: Remove debianutils dependency, it's essential.
  * Drop backends/packaging-dpkg.py. It had some hackish usage of python-apt
    anyway, since some things just cannot be figured out with dpkg alone.
    Since we have to give up on that idea, implement a new clean packaging
    backend 'packaging-apt-dpkg.py' which now uses python-apt and dpkg in a
    clean way.
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Fix crash when Stacktrace could not be
    created. (LP: #107853)
  * ./test-apport: Check that crashes create a core dump (with proper ulimits)
    when an unseen crash report exists already. This reproduces LP #105976.
  * bin/apport: Create core dump file if aborting because an unseen crash
    report already exists. (LP: #105976)
  * apport/ui.py: Add a comment for translators. (LP: #104703)
  * apport/ui.py, load_report(): Also catch zlib.error on invalid reports.
    (LP: #103547)
  * apport/report.py: Add method has_useful_stacktrace() to determine whether
    the stack trace can be considered useful. The current heuristic is to
    consider it useless if it either is shorter than three lines and has any
    unknown function, or for longer traces, a minority of known functions. Add
    test cases.
  * gtk/apport-gtk, qt4/apport-qt, cli/apport-cli: Do not offer 'reduced
    report' option if the stack trace is useless. (LP: #87430) Bump the
    python-apport dependencies of the frontend packages to ensure that we have
    has_useful_stacktrace().

  New feature: fakechroot support for apport-retrace

  * bin/apport-retrace:
    - Simplify program design and throw away the complicated debug symbol
      sandbox generation, along with the -d and -C options.  Instead, directly
      install the missing packages and ddebs with apt. This makes the tool more
      suitable for running in chroots and has often been requested anyway.
    - Add option -u/--unpack-only which causes additionally installed packages
      to be unpacked without being configured and purged again after
      retracing. This allows apport-retrace to work under fakechroot and has
      the nice side effect of speeding up package installation (we do not care
      about configuration for retracing anyway).
  * man/apport-retrace.1: Update description for the new behaviour, drop
    documentation of the -d and -C options, and add documentation of -u.
  * Add apport/chroot.py: Class for representing and working with chroots;
    this uses the fakeroot and fakechroot libraries when being called as
    non-root.
  * Add bin/apport-chroot: CLI frontend for doing various things with
    chroots (including fakeroot/fakechroot support from the Chroot class). For
    now, this implements:
    - create a chroot (tarball or directory)
    - dist-upgrade a particular or all chroots
    - apport-retrace a bug or Apport report file
  * setup.py: Ship apport-chroot in scripts directory.
  * Add a new package apport-retrace which ships apport-retrace and
    apport-chroot and carries all the heavier dependencies (binutils,
    python-launchpad-bugs, python-apt, etc.). Drop the latter two dependencies
    from the apport package. This allows us to install the apport-retrace
    package in fakechroots (not possible with apport itself) and avoid
    unnecessary dependencies on normal desktop installations.

apport (0.62) feisty; urgency=low

  * apport/ui.py, collect_info(): Use REThread instead of Thread and raise
    exceptions from it, so that errors during info collection actually become
    visible.
  * apport/report.py, add_proc_info(): Check that ExecutablePath actually
    exists, so that invalid values from transient error conditions are ignored
    (such as '/usr/bin/gnome-panel\x00\x00\x8b (deleted)').
  * apport/packaging.py: Add interface get_system_architecture() to return the
    system architecture in the distro specific notation. This can differ from
    get_architecture(package) on multiarch platforms such as amd64.
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py: Implement get_system_architecture() to return
    dpkg --print-architecture, add a shallow test case.
  * apport/report.py, add_package_info(): Rename key 'Architecture:' to
    'PackageArchitecture:' for clarity.
  * apport/report.py, add_os_info(): Add system architecture as
    'Architecture:' field.
  * apport/ui.py, create_crash_bug_title(): Append warning about non-native
    package if package architecture does not match the system's one.
  * All test suites: Remove redundant word 'behaviour' from test descriptions.
  * test-hooks: Run tests on installed hooks in /usr/share/apport by default
    and add a '--local' switch to test the hooks in the source tree instead.
    Use this option in run-tests.
  * apport/report.py, test_add_proc_info(): Change the python script test
    so that it does not depend on being run in the source tree.
  * run-tests: Add a 'local' command line option which runs tests on the files
    and modules in the build tree. Run tests on system files/modules by
    default.
  * setup.py, debian/apport.install: Ship test-hooks, test-apport, and
    run-tests in /usr/share/apport/testsuite/, so that the full test suite can
    be run in the installed system.
  * gtk/apport-gtk.desktop.in: Only show in Gnome and Xfce.

  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade: Reintroduce window titles. Since the crash

    buttons in the task bar. Let's have the smaller evil then. (LP: #87164)
  * apport/packaging.py: Add get_architecture() interface for determining the
    architecture of a particular package (which might not match the overall
    system architecture on multiarch-capable systems, e. g. an i386 Firefox
    package installed on amd64).
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py: Implement get_architecture() and add test
    case.
  * apport/report.py, add_package_info(): Add Architecture: field.
    (LP: #87424)
  * apport/ui.py: Already mark report as seen when we load it, not just in the
    information collection thread. That way, reports will only be shown once
    on systems which have /var/crash mounted noatime, too. (LP: #85809)
  * apport/fileutils.py, mark_report_seen(): If os.utime() fails, and opening
    the report file for reading does not change the atime (happens with
    noatime mount option), don't throw an exception, just delete the report.
    (other aspect of LP: #85809)

    scripts more robust. (LP: #87005)
  * test-apport, check_crash(): Differ between expecting the program dumping
    core and finding a core dump on disk, because this is not equivalent any
    more with core pipelining.
  * bin/apport: Write core files into a process' cwd if the process' ulimit
    requests and permits it and the crashes process is not packaged, so that
    developers get happy again. Test this behaviour with various ulimits in
    test-apport.
  * test-apport: Check that the core file written by apport is valid. This
    uncovers kernel bugs like #87065
  * problem_report.py test suite: Use assertAlmostEqual() when comparing stat
    times, since they are floats on some systems.
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info():

    - Add various options to override some report fields with local values.
    - Add --verbose option and be quiet by default.
    - Read ProcMaps for additional library dependencies, to also catch
      libraries loaded at runtime (plugins).
    - Set correct debug file directory when starting an interactive gdb
      session with -g.
  * Add gtk/apport-gtk.desktop.in: Desktop file for calling apport-gtk in
    'file a distro bug' mode, to be displayed in gnome-panel's System menu
    (see bug-reporting-tool spec). Also add a Makefile to do the
    intltool-merge dance, add it to POTFILES.in, and ship it in
    debian/apport-gtk.install.
  * bin/apport: Call add_os_info(), so that we get architecture information
    even for 'naked' reports which didn't go through UI enrichment.
  * Add ./test-hooks: Test suite for the various package hooks shipped with
    apport. Test the package problem hook for now.

  Bug fixes:

  * debian/control: Add missing python-apt dependency to apport

  * debian/control: Add gdb dependency to python-apport.
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py test suite: Verify that packages returned by

  New feature: Infrastructure for package install/upgrade failures:

  * Add bin/package_hook: Script for creating a report for a package
    installation/upgrade failure. It receives a package name, a number of log
    files, and an ErrorMessage: from stdin. This will be called from e.g.
    dist-upgrader.
  * setup.py, debian/apport.install: Ship package_hook.
  * apport/ui.py: If ProblemType is 'Package', call a new function
    self.ui_present_package_error() instead of presenting a crash. Add test
    suite checks for the package error report workflow.
  * apport/ui.py, create_crash_bug_title(): Create default bug title for
    package reports. Add various test cases.
  * gtk/apport-gtk{,.glade}: GTK implementation of ui_present_package_error().

  New feature: Maintain a per-binary blacklist to inhibit apport crash reports
  until the binary changes. Closes: LP#79408

  * apport/report.py: Add new Report methods check_ignored() and mark_ignore()
    to check for/set ignore list entries. Add test cases.
  * apport/ui.py: Add another return value of ui_present_crash() to specify
    whether or not to blacklist the current crash's executable. Check workflow
    of both responses in the test suite.
  * gtk/apport-gtk{,.glade}: Add a blacklist checkbox to the crash
    notification dialogs.
  * bin/apport: Do nothing if the current crash is blacklisted.
  * test-apport: Test blacklisting.

  Bug fixes:

  * gtk/apport-gtk: Fix return code for restarting the application ('reopen' ->
    'restart'). Closes: LP#81422
  * test-apport: Adapt to new core_pattern kernel interface mode:
    - Check core_pattern instead of the obsolete crashdump sysctl to determine
      whether or not apport is running.
    - Give apport max. 10 seconds to complete. The current kernel reaps the
      crashed process as soon as writing the core dump to the pipe is
      finished, but apport still needs to write the report file.
    - Do not EXFAIL the test for crashes in nonwriteable cwd any more, since
      it is now supposed to work (we do not write a core dump to the disk any
      more).
  * run-tests, use-local: Adapt to new core_pattern kernel interface.
  * apport: Improve logging of exceptions, include environment variables.
  * apport/report.py test suite: Use gdb to generate a test core dump, do not
    rely on kill(SIGSEGV) and the kernel to do it (since we now use a pipe in
    core_pattern).
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py: Fix return value of get_modified_files() if
    dpkg .list file is missing.
  * apport/report.py, add_package_info(): Do not produce stray empty lines for
    uninstalled alternative dependencies.
  * apport/report.py: Fix test_add_gdb_info_script() to not leave behind a
    stray gzip process which randomly blocks stdin. Closes: LP#78421
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py: Do not read the dpkg status in the
    constructor, but lazily initialize it when actually calling a query
    function. This avoids imposing the dpkg-query overhead for programs that
    import the apport package without doing package queries (such as any
    Python program under Ubuntu, due to the Python crash hook).
  * apport/ui.py, create_crash_bug_title():
    - Do not crash on an empty StacktraceTop. Closes: LP#81677
    - Do not mention an unknown function name ('??') in the bug title;
      instead, use the topmost function with a known name, or leave it out
      at all.
    - Add test cases for these situations.
  * apport/report.py, _get_ignore_dom(): Do not throw an error for an empty
    ignore list file.

  Code cleanups:

  * apport/report.py test suite: Refactorize generation of test crash program
    and core dump generation.
  * Consistently use 'in'/'not in' instead of find() for substring searches.
  * Changed the packaging backend import, so that its methods can now be
    accessed at apport.packaging instead of apport.packging.impl.

  Some more 'Need for Speed' optimizations:

  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py, _check_files_md5(): Also accept a md5sum
    string in addition to a md5sum file.
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py, get_modified_files(): Compare package file's
    ctime and mtime against the package list file's mtime and only md5sum the
    files that are newer. This drastically reduces the amount of md5suming
    (usually to zero) and thus speeds up the information collection.
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py: Use a single hackish 'dpkg-query --show *'
    as a portable variant of 'cat /var/lib/dpkg/status' to pre-fill the status
    cache with all packages instead of calling dpkg -s on every single package
    we query. This changes the time for figuring out dependencies and their
    versions from 'unbearable for many packages' to 'barely noticeable'.

  New feature: per-package apport hooks to collect additional information:

  * apport/report.py: Add method add_hooks_info() which executes a function
    add_info(report) from /usr/share/apport/<package>.py. Also add
    appropriate test cases. This provides per-package hooks for apport.
  * apport/ui.py: Call add_hooks_info() in the information collection thread.

  Bug fixes:

  * apport/report.py: Add some more test cases for _check_interpreted() for
    Python scripts.
  * apport/python_hook.py: Check for a correct ExecutablePath in
    test_general().
  * apport/python_hook.py: Use fileutils.likely_packaged() instead of
    checking for /tmp and home, so that we ignore stuff in /usr/local, too.
    Closes: LP#81244
  * apport/python_hook.py: If we figure out an ExecutablePath which is not
    actually an executable, do not create a report. This particularly affects
    interactive python sessions where sys.argv[0] is empty and thus
    ExecutablePath ends up being the current directory. Add test cases.

  * apport/ui.py, file_report(): Submit a default bug title for crash reports.

  New feature: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApportImprovements (kernel interface
  change):

  * bin/apport: Support calling without arguments, to support new semantics
    agreed in the ApportImprovements spec: macro values (in particular, pid
    and signal number) are passed as environment variables.
  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Simulate new kernel behaviour described above.
  * debian/apport.init: Set the kernel's core_pattern sysctl to pipe to apport
    if the edgy-style 'crashdump-helper' sysctl helper does not exist.

  Bug fixes:

  * bin/apport-retrace: Beautify error message when report file is not
    accessible. Closes: LP#79568
  * apport/ui.py: Fix crash in the bug pattern search thread if we could
    not determine a package name. Closes: LP#77872
  * bin/apport: Only unlink the core dump if it still exists. Closes: LP#80866
  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade: Fix expand/fill attributes so that the expander gets
    all the space when resizing the window. Closes: LP#80987
  * problem_report.py, write_mime(): Make sure that multi-line values that go
    to the summary are terminated with a newline.
  * apport/ui.py: Fix error message invocation for reporting cloakroom upload
    failure.
  * problem_report.py, write_mime(): Fix off-by-one comparison of the 'inline
    text' treshold, so that apport's StacktraceTop field appears in bug
    summaries. Also fix a corner case in CR line ending handling. Check both
    things in the test suite.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Add missing 'import subprocess.'. Closes: LP#81007
  * debian/control: Bump apport's and apport-gtk's dependency to python-apport
    to make sure that apport.ui is available. Closes: LP#81019
  * apport/ui.py: Add missing 'import pwd'. Closes: LP#81033

  * apport/ui.py: Get the cloakroom ticket number from the
    X-Launchpad-Blob-Token HTTP header instead of parsing the resulting page.

  New feature: Use Malone cloakroom for uploading reports. Closes: LP#70919

  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade: Redesign bug reporting dialog to have a 'Create bug
    report' and a 'Cancel' button. Also assign GTK_RESPONSE_* constants to the
    dialog buttons. Go back to Glade 2 since Glade 3 still sucks too much.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Adjust workflow for sending report to Malone cloakroom
    instead of asking the user to attach the file. Sending is not yet
    implemented, though.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Do not show any dialogs any more when filing a bug.
  * Add apport/MultipartPostHandler.py: This module provides an urllib2 opener
    for uploading file attachments to forms over HTTP POST. This module is
    (C) 2006 Will Holcomb <wholcomb@gmail.com> and was taken from
    http://odin.himinbi.org/MultipartPostHandler.py. (This is a serious hole
    of the Python standard library IMHO.)
  * apport/ui.py, file_report(): Upload blob to Malone (edge.launchpad.net for
    now), retrieve the ticket, and pass it to +filebug.

  Refactorizations:

  * gtk/apport-gtk: Major refactorization to use modal dialogs and run()
    instead of loosely coupled event handlers.
  * Add apport/ui.py: Abstract frontend which encapsulates the logic, workflow
    and UI independent bits and provides UI hooks for concrete
    implementations. This both makes it easy to write more frontends like Qt
    or CLI, and also makes the code automatically testable. Add an extensive
    testsuite.
  * run-tests: Add ui.py testsuite.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Port to ui.py's UserInterface (which means moving 1/3 of
    the code into the new ui_*() methods and throwing away the rest).
  * Add apport/REThread.py: Enhanced threading.Thread class that can propagate
    the return value and uncaught exceptions of run() to the calling thread.
  * apport/ui.py: Get rid of thread_check_bugpatterns() and hackish exception
    handling, rewrite using REThread.
  * apport/ui.py, gtk/apport-gtk: Add progress bar to report upload. It is
    indefinite for now, because neither urllib2 nor httplib support upload
    progress.

  Bug fixes:

  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade: Merged Gnome HIG fixes from Sebastian Heinlein,
    thank you!
  * Merge patch from Sebastian Heinlein to properly treat the apport-gtk icon
    the dh_iconcache way and make it themeable. Thank you!
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Remove periods from primary dialog texts to comply with
    Gnome HIG standards.
  * backends/packaging-dpkg.py, get_file_package(): Process list files in
    chunks of 100, so that we do not exceed the maximum command line length if
    there is a large number of packages installed. Closes: LP#64839
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Use pgrep with -u instead of pidof for testing whether the
    crashed process is already running again, so that we do not match
    processes of other users. Add procps package dependency for this.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Only offer to restart programs that are in the $PATH. E.
    g. /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin cannot be called directly.
    Closes: LP#79623
  * apport/report.py: Disassemble 16 instructions instead of 32 bytes to
    become independent of the instruction size. Thanks to Kees Cook for the
    patch!

  * Introduce abstract packaging interface and move all dpkg/apt specific bits
    to a dpkg implementation of this packaging interface (merge

    - Add backends/packaging-dpkg.py: dpkg implementation of abstract
      packaging interface.
    - run-tests: Run tests of all backends.
    - apport/fileutils.py, apport/report.py: Port to packaging.py interface.
    - debian/control: Drop python-apport's 'python-apt' dependency since the
      backend only uses dpkg now (without measurable performance penalty since
      it uses internal caching).
    - debian/rules: Install backends/packaging-dpkg.py as our packaging

    be run as root to be able to actually check their complete behaviour.
    Adapt the other tests to get along with running the tests as root.
  * bin/apport-checkreports: Add option --system to check for system crash
    reports. Closes: LP#62316
  * gtk/apport-gtk: If called through sudo to process system crashes, drop
    privileges to the original user in open_url() so that we get the web
    browser correctly. (LP#62316) Caveat: The user cannot actually attach the
    crash report file directly since it is not accessible to the user; this

    a single space). Closes: LP#78094
  * apport/report.py test suite: Do not rely on a particular structure of the
    'cat' stacktrace; apparently this is not consistent across architectures.
    Instead, compile a segfaulting mini C program, let it dump core, and test
    add_gdb_info() on it instead. This also allows us for a more rigid check

  * gtk/apport-gtk: Defer opening of the bug reporting window a bit so that
    it appears on top of the browser window. Also enable the task bar blinking
    for it when it is in the background.
  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade: Restore vertical padding of bug report dialog labels
    (another Glade 3 transition regression).
  * bin/apport-retrace, apport/report.py: Call gdb on InterpreterPath if
    present; calling it on a script does not yield anything useful. Add a test
    case to report.py.
  * debian/apport.init: Use mkdir -p instead of install -d, since install is

  Optimizations:

  * apport/fileutils.py: Split out heuristics for determining whether a file
    belongs to a package to new function likely_packaged() and add test cases.
  * bin/apport: Do not use the expensive find_file_package() any more, use
    likely_packaged() instead. This will create initial reports in some
    corner cases (like custom non-packaged executables in /usr/bin/), but
    greatly reduces I/O impact at crash time. We rely on apport-gtk to deal
    with reports that do not actually belong to a packaged executable.
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Call gdb just once and split the output
    instead of calling it again for each command. This should significantly
    speed up the gdb stage especially for large programs/core dumps.
  * Use cStringIO instead of StringIO in modules.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Code cleanup and refactorization:
    - Move iteration over crash reports into __main__ to simplify housekeeping
      in the ApportGTK class and get rid of some functions.
    - Refactor creation of temporary report file.
  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade: Split the text in the progress bar dialog so that we
    can use it for multiple steps (like uploading data to Malone) while not
    breaking translations.

  New feature: Bug reporting tool (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugReportingTool)

  * gtk/apport-gtk: Split out crash report initialization to new function
    show_crashes() so that we can use the frontend for other purposes like bug
    reporting.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Add --file-bug, --package, and --pid options; if given,
    create a bug report about the given package instead of viewing crash
    reports.
  * gtk/apport-gtk{,.glade}: Generalize some strings to not talk about 'crash'
    any more, to make them suitable for bug reporting, too.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Support --file-bug without specifying a package or a PID
    for filing generic distro bugs.
  * problem_report.py: Add new method write_mime() to encode a problem report
    in MIME/Multipart RFC 2822 format (i. e. an email with attachments). Short
    values are aggregated into the first inline text/plain part, large values,
    binary values, and file references get gzip compressed separate
    attachments. Also add various test cases.

  Bug/crash information:

  * apport/report.py, add_user_info(): Add list of system groups that the user
    belongs to.
  * bin/apport: Call add_user_info(), check functionality in test-apport.
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Add field 'StacktraceTop' with the top
    five functions on the stack and no local variables. This reduced 'glimpse'
    is suitable for inline display in bug reports and automatic processing
    (dup finders, etc).

  Bug fixes:

  * po/Makefile: Add top_srcdir to work with current intltool.
  * po/de.po: Unfuzz some strings.
  * apport/report.py, add_gdb_info(): Strip away the 'No symbol table info
    available' messages from stack traces.
  * apport/report.py, test_search_bug_patterns(): Use security.u.c. instead
    of archive.u.c., since the latter times out too often.

  * Drop the apport_utils module (and with it the python-apport-utils

    functions now live in apport.fileutils, and the debugging information
    collectors are now methods of a new 'Report' class (subclass of

  * Add debian/python-apport.postinst: Remove old .pyc and .pyo cruft on
    upgrades to clean up after our broken dh_pysupport invocation in earlier

  * debian/apport.init, test-apport, use-local: Adapt to 'crashdump-helper' ->
    'crashdump' sysctl renaming in 2.6.19.
  * test-apport: Restore cwd even when failing a test.
  * problem_report.py, ProblemReport.write(): Support file-like objects as
    argument of file references to support direct reading from pipes. Add test
    case test_write_fileobj().
  * apport: Support '-' as core file argument, in which case the core will be
    read from stdin. This paves the way for using Linux 2.6.19's 'pipe
    core_pattern' feature. Bump python-problem-report dependency to >= 0.29
    for this.
  * apport: Confine permissions of log file to root:adm 0640, just in case.
  * apport: Temporarily drop real u/gid to target user for the os.access()
    tests, so that normal users cannot verify the existence of a given
    inaccessible file. Add comprehensive tests to apport_utils' test suite and
    test-apport. Thanks to Kees Cook for this patch!
  * apport_utils.py, find_file_package(): Terminate fgrep options with '--' to
    avoid problems with funny file names. Thanks to Kees Cook for spotting
    this!
  * test-apport: Automatically detect whether ULIMIT_CORE is nonzero, and
    adapt tests accordingly: check that core still exists after invoking
    apport, and clean it up.
  * apport-retrace: Add new mode -g/--gdb which starts an interactive gdb
    session with the report's core dump. Add this to man/apport-retrace.1, too.
  * apport-retrace: If -c is given, completely remove the CoreDump field from
    the report instead of setting it to 'removed'.
  * test-apport: When using 'lib' mode, point APPORT_LOG_FILE to a temporary
    file. Print it if the test suite fails.
  * test-apport: Fix EXFAILure of the 'core dump works for non-writable cwds'
    test case.
  * preloadlib: Support -DPIPE_CORE mode which emulates the
    pipe-in-core_pattern mode of kernel 2.6.19.
  * test-apport: Build preload library with core piping. No more failed test
    suite checks in 'lib' mode.

  "No core - ignore!"

  * apport: Do not create a report for crashes which we do not get a core dump
    for. The reports are useless and only clutter our bug tracker.

apport (0.27) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport: Ignore SIGABRT for now; it's usually signalled from abort() or
    assertion failures and we only get reports with unusable stack traces for
    it (see #61938).
  * gtk/apport-gtk: If gnome-open is not available, fall back to x-www-browser
    instead of using webbrowser.py, to respect default browser in XFCE.
    Closes: LP#64209
  * apport: use os.nice() instead of executing 'renice'. Thanks to Benoit
    Boissinot for noticing.
  * apport_utils.py, find_file_package(): Lower() both strings in the speedup
    heuristics to match e. g. /usr/bin/Xorg -> xserver-xorg. Thanks to Kees
    Cook!
  * apport_utils.py, report_add_package_info(): Do not crash if we encounter a
    'None' current version, which can happen with uninstalled alternative
    dependencies. Thanks to Kees Cook for tracking this down!

apport (0.26) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport-retrace: Clean up code a bit:
    - Move option parsing to separate function.
    - Use apport_utils' report_add_gdb_info() instead of duplicating the gdb
      code.
  * apport_utils.py, report_add_gdb_info(): Add optional parameter 'debugdir'
    to specify an alternate debug file symbol root directory.
  * apport-retrace: Add option -d/--download-debug to automatically download
    available ddebs, create a temporary debug symbol directory from already
    installed and downloaded ddebs, and point gdb to use that. Also add option
    -C/--cache-dir to specify a permanent ddeb cache directory (by default, a
    temporary one is used). Update the manpage accordingly.
  * apport-retrace: Make the best out of a report without packaging
    information (which can happen if the user does not click on 'report bug'
    in apport-gtk).
  * apport_utils, report_add_proc_info():
    - Move heuristics for detecting interpreted scripts to a separate function
      to be able to provide separate test cases for it. Check a few more
      special cases for mono programs.
    - Make interpreter heuristics even scarier to detect some more mono corner
      cases (like banshee and beagled-helper). Closes: LP#58859

apport (0.25) edgy; urgency=low

  * Drop apport-gtk's update-notifier dependency to a Recommends:.
  * apport_utils.py, report_add_gdb_info(): Add register dump and disassembly
    of the last 32 bytes, they might be useful to see what's going on
    sometimes. Thanks to Kees Cook for the idea and the patch.
  * test-apport, check_crash(): Verify that a crash does not leave a core file
    behind. (Test for LP#62972)
  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Do not unlink the core file after calling apport,
    but set REMOVE_CORE=1 environment instead. This matches the current
    kernel behaviour.
  * apport: Register an atexit handler as early as possible for unlinking the
    core dump if REMOVE_CORE environment is set. Closes: LP#62972
  * apport: Set nice level 10 instead of 5. Closes: LP#63099

apport (0.24) edgy; urgency=low

  The "Need for speed" release -- rrrroarrr!

  * apport: Remove _copy_shrink_corefile(): While this has an enormous impact
    on the size of an uncompressed core dump, it only causes a negligible size
    reduction of the bzip2'ed core, but it needs a lot of I/O resources for
    large core dumps.
  * problem_report.py:
    - Use zlib instead of bzip2 for compressing the binary data (in
      particular, core dumps). This results in slightly bigger files, but speeds
      up compression a lot (30 seconds vs. ~2:45 minutes for a Firefox core dump
      on my slow iBook). Closes: LP#61538
    - ProblemReport.read(): Support both bzip2 and zlib compression to be able
      to read existing reports, too.
    - Add/Adapt test cases.
  * Move InformationCollector._get_gdb() from apport to apport_utils.py
    report_add_gdb_info(), and add a test case for it.
  * apport_utils.py, report_add_package_info(): Support calling without a
    package name, then it will be figured out from ExecutableName. Extend test
    case accordingly.
  * test-apport: Do not require apport reports to contain gdb, packaging, and
    OS information, since we are going to move them out of apport.
  * apport: Do not collect static information. It requires a lot of CPU and
    I/O resources and slows down the machine a lot, and it can be added to
    the report later in the frontend. This also gets rid of the entire
    InformationCollector class, since everything has been moved to
    apport_utils.py now. Closes: LP#62542
  * apport: Do not intercept KeyboardInterrupt as unhandled exception (only
    useful for command line debugging, though).
  * problem_report.py: Add test case for appending new data to an existing
    report, fix write() function to not rely on an existing ProblemType key.
  * problem_report.py: Add new method ProblemReport.add_to_existing() to
    update an already existing problem report with new data. Add test case.
  * apport_utils.py, mark_report_seen(): Use os.utime() instead of
    open()/read() and a timeout for simpler and faster operation.
  * gtk/apport-gtk:
    - Collect gdb/packaging/operating system information when the user chooses
      to file a bug and update the apport report.
    - Change the 'Downloading bug patterns...' progress dialog to 'Collecting
      information about the crash...'.
  * debian/control: Bumped library dependencies of apport-gtk, added
    update-notifer dependency.

apport (0.23) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport: Reset signal handler to SIG_IGN in the crash signal handler, to
    avoid an endless crash/handler loop (noticed during debugging LP#61708).
  * debian/apport.init: Do not let the script run with set -e, so that
    do_{start,stop} can deliver their return codes for proper evaluation,
    instead of immediately existing. Closes: LP#61796
  * test-apport: Check that SIGQUIT does not generate a report. (Check for
    bug #62511).
  * apport: Ignore SIGQUIT. Closes: LP#62511

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 28 Sep 2006 20:57:38 +0200

apport (0.22) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport_utils.py, report_add_proc_info(): Make 'interpreted script'
    detection more general to also work for mono programs.
  * test-apport: Check that non-packaged scripts do not generate a report.
  * apport: Call ic.collect_runtime_information() earlier and drop the local
    /proc/pid/exe examination, so that we get proper script detection. This
    avoids getting crash reports for non-packaged scripts (see test case
    change from above).
  * apport: Do not try to chmod the report file if we could not create it and
    output to stderr instead (this mainly affects local testing only).
  * apport_utils.py, find_file_package(): First grep the package lists whose
    names are a substring of the crashed binary name (or vice versa), to
    immensely speed up the package name determination in many cases.
  * apport: Drop the maximum number of consecutive crashes per executable
    from 5 to 2. 5 creates a too bad user experience and creates the
    impression that it will never stop. Closes: LP#61078

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 19 Sep 2006 16:16:46 +0200

apport (0.21) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport: Keep a partially written report with '000' permissions, and only
    chmod it to 0600 when it is fully written. This stops update-notifier from
    picking up half-written reports and get activated several times.
    Closes: LP#59988
  * apport: Add the executable path to the first line of logging.
  * apport: Run the complete code under control of the general exception
    fallback handler.
  * debian/apport.default: Increase maximum core size to 200 MB, to also catch
    Firefox and Evolution core dumps.
  * apport_utils.py, find_file_package(): Before searching the dpkg database
    (which is expensive), check if the executable path matches a whitelist of
    path prefixes. This replaces the weaker blacklist (/tmp and /home) in
    apport itself.
  * gtk/apport-gtk: Show a progress dialog while checking for bug patterns and
    execute report_search_bug_patterns() in a separate thread, so that the UI
    is not potentially blocked for a long time.
  * apport: Gracefully abort if we cannot readlink /proc/pid/exe, instead of
    falling over with an exception. Closes: LP#59993
  * debian/rules: Use 'multiuser' instead of 'defaults' for dh_installinit.
    Clean up the unnecessary rc symlinks in postinst and add appropriate
    sysv-rc dependency.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 14 Sep 2006 23:16:26 +0200

apport (0.20) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport: Renice ourself to priority 5 to not slow down the user's processes
    so heavily.
  * Add manpages for apport-retrace(1) and apport-unpack(1) and install them
    into apport. Closes: LP#58463
  * problem_report.py: Test attaching two files instead of one in the
    test_write_file() regression check to assert correct key sorting.
  * problem_report.py: Alter write() method to sort binary data to the end of
    the report. This makes reports easier to read, and also shows relevant
    information more quickly when progressively loading them in a web browser.
    Adapt regression tests accordingly.
  * Move setting of ExecutablePath from apport's InformationCollector ctor to
    apport_utils' report_add_proc_info(), where it belongs to. Check
    ExecutablePath in apport_utils' regression tests.
  * apport-unpack: Support '-' as report argument to read from stdin.
  * apport_utils.py, report_add_proc_info():
    - Apply some heuristics to determine whether the crashed process is an
      interpreted script (check if the Name in /proc/pid/status matches
      the second /proc/pid/cmdline part, and if that command line argument is
      an existing executable file). In the case of an interpreted script, set
      ExecutablePath to the script and InterpreterPath to the actually crashed
      ELF binary.
    - Test this with a shell (/bin/zgrep) and a Python (./apport-unpack)
      script in the test suite.
    - Closes: LP#58859
  * Add debian/apport.logrotate to add a daily 7-step /var/log/apport
    log rotation.
  * test-apport: Fix WCOREDUMP() and pidof checks in check_crash().
  * apport: Install a signal handler for all 'crashy' signals, which just logs
    the signal and stack info and exits. This should avoid a crashing apport
    examining itself, possibly in an endless loop. Closes: LP#58873

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 11 Sep 2006 09:20:18 +0200

  * apport_utils.py: Add function report_search_bug_patterns(): Try to
    download a package specific bug pattern XML file from a given URL base
    directory and return the bug URL in case of a match. Also add extensive
    test suite check.
  * test-apport: Fix help message.
  * apport-gtk: Make use of the new report_search_bug_patterns() function and
    display appropriate instructions on match. Bump python-apport-utils dependency.

apport (0.18) edgy; urgency=low

  The "mating dance for ubiquity" release.

  * apport-gtk:
    - Use pidof's -x option in the detection whether the program is already
      running to correctly handle scripts.
    - Do not assume the presence of the ExecutablePath key in reports, but
      gracefully fall back to Package.
    - If the report specifies an explicit DesktopFile, use that instead of
      trying to figure it out.
    - Only created reduced report and show the radio buttons if there are
      actually removed fields.
    - Change tooltip of 'reduced report' radio button to be more generic (do
      not refer to the memory dump, but to 'large items', since this is what
      apport-gtk currently does).
    - Support new field 'BugDisplayMode: file | list (default)'. In 'file'
      mode, display the /+filebug page instead of /+bugs and change
      instructions accordingly.
    - Use the ProcCmdline attibute to restart an application; correctly
      parsing of all the desktop file is just not possible at this point.
    - Support new field 'RespawnCommand' to use custom respawning command.
  * problem_report.py: Add method has_removed_fields() to check whether load()
    skipped any fields due to binary=False. Add test suite check.
  * apport_utils.py: Fix the quoting in ProcCmdline so that it is fully shell
    compatible.
  * run-tests: Check if kernel crash dump helper is active, and if so, run
    test-apport in kernel mode.
  * problem_report.py: Support an optional second argument of file references
    which controls whether or not the file contents will be compressed/encoded
    (defaults to True for backwards compatibility). Add test suite checks.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 25 Aug 2006 14:01:47 +0200

apport (0.17) edgy; urgency=low

  * Move packaging information collection from apport to new function
    report_add_package_info() in apport_utils.py, add test suite check.
  * Move operating system information collection from apport to new function
    report_add_os_info() in apport_utils.py, add test suite check.
  * Move /proc information collection from apport to new function
    report_add_proc_info() in apport_utils.py, add test suite check, and fix
    handling of failed /proc/$$/environ reading.
  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Route gcore's stderr to /dev/null to suppress
    error messages during the test suite and to become more compatible to the
    kernel behaviour.
  * Change apport_utils.py to be a public module and ship it in the new
    python-apport-utils package, so that other applications like ubiquity can
    use it easily.
  * po/de.po: Add new translations to make this complete again.
  * problem_report.py, apport_utils.py: Prepend UnitTest classes with '_' so
    that they do not appear in the help() output.
  * apport_utils.py: Add make_report_path(), which constructs the canonical
    crash report pathname for a given report.
  * Add debian/apport.postinst: Remove /usr/share/apport/apport_utils.pyc when
    upgrading from an earlier version, so that the programs in
    /usr/share/apport actually use the version from p-apport-utils.

apport (0.16) edgy; urgency=low

  *  test-apport: Check that non-packaged binaries do not generate a report.
  * apport_utils.py: Add find_file_package() to find the package a file
    belongs to. This uses fgrep /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list which is much faster
    than dpkg -S. Also add test suite check.
  * apport: Use find_file_package() instead of direct dpkg -S call and pass
    the result to the InformationCollector ctor to avoid grepping the dpkg
    lists twice.
  * apport: Immediately exit if the executable name starts with /home or /tmp,
    to avoid grepping the dpkg database in the common developer case.
  * apport: Replace 0-bytes in ProcCmdline with spaces to keep them readable.
  * apport-gtk: Offer an alternative small report (without the core dump) for
    users with slow internet connection.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 21 Aug 2006 19:34:47 +0200

apport (0.15) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add apport-unpack: Script to extract the fields of a problem report into
    separate files into a new or empty directory. Mainly useful for extracting
    compressed binary data like the core dump.
  * test-apport: Check that dumped environment only contains security
    insensitive variables.
  * apport: Filter out all environment variables but $SHELL, $PATH, and
    locale/language related ones. Closes: LP#56846
  * test-apport: Delete test report in the cleanup handler so that the
    kernel-mode test can be run multiple times without manual cleanup.
  * test-apport: Check for running apport and test executable processes in
    check_crash().
  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Improve error checking, some robustification.
  * test-apport: If using the preload library, wait a second between the test
    process invocations in the flooding test to mitigate a strange race
    condition that sometimes causes the signal handler not to be executed.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 20 Aug 2006 16:28:43 +0200

apport (0.14) edgy; urgency=low

  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Write core dump into cwd instead of /tmp to act
    like the current kernel.
  * apport_utils.py: Check APPORT_REPORT_DIR environment variable for an
    alternate crash report directory. This is mainly useful for a local test
    suite.
  * apport: Quiesce the apt module's FutureWarning.
  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Re-raise the signal instead of doing exit() so
    that the process exits with the same code as it would do without the
    library.
  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Close stdout for gcore process.
  * Add test-apport: Use preloadlib/ and APPORT_REPORT_DIR to create a
    sandboxed environment and run various apport functionality tests. Also add
    this script to run-tests.
  * apport_utils.py, delete_report(): Actually try to unlink the report before
    falling back to truncating it to zero bytes.
  * preloadlib/libapport.c: Close stderr for apport process.

apport (0.12) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport-gtk: Make bug report window resizable when the details are
    expanded. Closes: LP#56672
  * apport_utils.py: Add get_recent_crashes() and a test suite check for it.
  * apport: If the same binary produced more than 5 crashes in the last 24
    hours, ignore the crash. This is a hideous and pretty ad-hoc band-aid to
    avoid flooding users with reports for continuously crashing respawning
    processes. Closes: LP#56362
  * apport: Clean up exit codes to only exit with 0 if report was created, and
    with 1 otherwise (to become more compatible to proposed future kernel
    behaviour, where core dumps are only generated on demand).
  * Add run-tests script which calls all available selftests.
  * debian/rules: Run run-tests during build to have the package FTBFS on
    regressions. Add python build dependency for this (it is already there
    implicitly anyway).

apport (0.11) edgy; urgency=low

  * gtk/apport-gtk.glade: Remove separators from dialogs. Closes: LP#56326
  * apport:
    - Move information collection from ctor to two new separate functions
      collect_runtime_information() (fast, privileged, crashed process must
      exist) and collect_static_information() (slow, unprivileged, crashed
      process does not need to exist). This allows a cleaner design.
    - Add missing close() call in init_error_log().
    - Do not catch SystemExit in the final catch-all-and-log clause (will
      become important once we switch to master/slave processes).
    - Clean up handling of temporary files.
    - Log successful report creation with file and package name, to ease
      debugging.
    - transitive_dependencies(): Do not break on pure virtual dependencies
      (like perl-api-XXX).
  * Add debian/apport.default: Default file to disable apport entirely and to
    change the maximum size of kernel created core dumps.
  * debian/apport.init: Evaluate new default file.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 16 Aug 2006 17:05:19 +0200

apport (0.10) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport-gtk: Show report file size in bug report window.
  * apport: Correctly handle relative paths to core dumps (use crashed

  * Fix the GPL URLs in source file's copyright comments.
  * debian/apport.cron.daily: Add -mindepth 1 to find commands to avoid
    attempting to remove the /var/crash/ directory. Closes: LP#55107
  * problem_report.py:
    - Fix precise whitespace handling in continuation lines, add selftest.
    - Add selftest for reading a report, modifying fields, and writing it
      back.
    - Fix writing back binary data, adapt test suite to check it.
    - Fixed ProblemReport.load() to clean up old data, added selftest.
    - Restructure class to inherit from IterableUserDict and throw away all
      the now obsolete dictionary wrapper methods.
  * debian/apport.init: Add colon to description to make output less
    confusing.
  * Add apport-retrace and install it into apport: This tool takes a crash
    report and refreshes the stack traces in it. This is particularly useful
    if debug symbols are installed now, but haven't been at the time the crash
    occured.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 11 Aug 2006 15:40:05 +0200

apport (0.9) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport: Call objcopy to throw out READONLY/CODE sections from the core
    dump, which drastically reduces its (uncompressed) size (factor 2 to 10).
    This has little effect on the bzip2'ed core dump, though.
  * apport:
    - Support an optional third command line argument which specifies the
      location of a core dump.
    - If a core dump is given, call gdb on the core dump instead of the
      crashed process. We cannot attach to the latter if we are called by the
      kernel (since the crashed process is in uninterruptible kernel sleep).
    - If no core dump is given, do not attempt to do anything gdb related.
    - This matches the future behaviour of the kernel crash dump helper while
      remaining compatible to the previous call semantics.
  * Add preloadlib/{Makefile,libapport.c}: LD_PRELOADable library which
    emulates the future kernel behaviour. This is ONLY for testing and
    development purposes. It uses unsafe temporary file handling and thus must
    not be used on production boxes!
  * Ship preloadlib/* as examples in package 'apport' for people who want to
    play with it until the new kernel arrives.
  * Add preloadlib/README: Explain how to use the preload library.

apport (0.8) edgy; urgency=low

  * apport_utils.py:
    - Add two new functions seen_report() and mark_report_seen().
    - get_new_reports(): Only return unseen reports, add function
      get_all_reports() for the old behaviour.
  * gtk/apport-gtk.py: Do not delete reports after notifying about them. This
    way, we do not need to add another button to save the report (which is
    considered evil UI-wise), but still retain the report for filing and
    examining later.
  * Replace all usages of '/var/crash' to a new global variable in
    apport_utils; this is particularly useful for test suites.
  * apport.py: Overwrite old reports if they are seen.
  * apport_utils.py: Add a test suite for all exported functions.

apport (0.7) edgy; urgency=low

  * Add apport_utils.py: Factorize out some common code of apport-gtk,
    possible future frontends, and some backend tools.
  * Add apport-checkreports: Test if there are new crash reports for the
    invoking user. This factorizes out the tests we currently do in
    update-notifier and makes them easier to change and keep in sync with
    apport itself. Ship the script in the apport package.

apport (0.4) edgy; urgency=low

  * Implement completely new UI according to the design described at
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CrashReporting. Many thanks to Matthew Paul
    Thomas!
  * po/Makefile: Fix default target to not just break. Now it builds the .pot
    file.
  * debian/rules: Build .pot file on package build for automatic Rosetta
    import.
  * Bring German translations up to date.
  * po/Makefile: Supply '--language=python' to intltool-update to properly
    extract strings from apport-gtk.

apport (0.3) edgy; urgency=low

  * debian/rules clean: Also clean po/.
  * debian/apport.cron.daily: Clean away empty files everytime.
  * apport: Only consider a report as already present if it has a non-zero
    size.
  * apport: Set proper group for report files instead of 'root'.
  * apport-gtk: Ignore 0-sized reports.
  * apport-gtk: Add button to remove the current report (by truncating the
    file to zero bytes; a user cannot unlink files in /var/crash).
  * apport-gtk: Only display reports that the user can actually read.
  * problem_report.py: Add 'binary' option to ProblemReport.load() to
    optionally skip binary data.
  * debian/rules: Clean stale *.pyc files.
  * python-gtk: Do not load binary data (core dumps, etc.) to greatly speed up
    the GUI. They are just gibberish anyway.
  * apport: Switch from apt_pkg to apt, add SourcePackage: to reports.
  * apport-gtk: Use source package name for the Malone URL.
  * debian/rules: Call setup.py install with --no-compile to not ship *.pyc in
    debs.

  * debian/apport.cron.daily: Do not produce error messages if 'find' does not
    find any crash reports.
  * problem_report.py: Support iterators, add test case.
  * apport: Filter out trailing 0-byte from ProcCmdline.
  * Add a simple GTK frontend, ship it in new package apport-gtk.
