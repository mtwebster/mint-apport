.SH NAME

apport\-unpack \- extract the fields of a problem report to separate files

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B apport\-unpack
.I report target\-directory

.SH DESCRIPTION

A problem report, as produced by
.B apport
is a single file with a set of key/value pairs in the RFC822 
syntax. This tool disassembles a report such that the value of each entry
is written into a separate file, with the key as file name. This is
particularly useful for large binary data like the core dump.

.I report 
is either a path to an existing apport crash report, or '\-' to read
from stdin.

The 
.I target\-directory
must either be nonexisting or empty.

.SH AUTHOR
.B apport
and the accompanying tools are developed by Martin Pitt
<martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>.
